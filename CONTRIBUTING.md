- Check existing scripts [project here.](https://github.com/Python-World/Python_and_the_Web)
- **Star** the repository.
- On the [GitHub page for this repository](https://github.com/Python-World/Python_and_the_Web), click on the Button "**Fork**".

   ![code ui](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png)

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Python_and_the_Web.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Python-World/Python_and_the_Web.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

- Create a folder in one of the folders in the [Scripts' directory](https://github.com/Python-World/Python_and_the_Web/tree/master/Scripts) according to issue name.
- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the [README_TEMPLATE.](https://github.com/chavarera/python-mini-projects/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md)
- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code *to your repository*.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

- Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

    ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- Now wait, until one of us *reviews your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
























This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new scripts to this project.

# Submitting Contributions
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.
## Step 0 : Find an issue
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

## Step 1 : Fork the Project
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
$ cd <repo-name>
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>
```
![script1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44089458/86088965-ebc2f400-bac4-11ea-80d3-80d5e52e4353.jpg)

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
```
$ git remote update
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```
## Step 2 : Branch
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.
```
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
## Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned
- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you. 
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:
```
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name
$ git add .
```
## Step 4 : Commit
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reveiwer by:
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'message
```
- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.
## Step 5 : Work Remotely
- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name
```
- Here is how your branch will look.
