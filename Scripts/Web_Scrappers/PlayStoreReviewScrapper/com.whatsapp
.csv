1,Mario Savi,1,"Since a week or so the app is not recording audio messages. I need to restart the phone to get it to work. I thought it was the Android 10 update of my Fairphone but now I see a lot of users complaining about so many problems that I'm not sure what it is anymore... It used to work quite well, I'm sad to give a low score but it's the only way to grab the company's attention..."
2,Mohsen Ahmed,1,"I don't know what happened to this app . It was one of the best apps but now it's the worst. Sometimes not able to share some videos or pictures to other contacts , only forwarding which also not allow me more than 1 recipient only. Moreover, I used to share media with other group of broadcasting, but now when chose sharing option, these groups doesn't appear in the list. I have to open one by one and select it from the attach file."
3,Keerthana Babu,5,"This app is very useful for chating and calling. It's a new experience. This app is very useful for our studies, assignments, home work, etc. They have many negative and positive impact. So my dear friends usage of this app will be reduced. This is a good tool for education. But a student have spent in online 72 hours in per week. That mean students have been many physical and mental problems in their life. So my dear friends i am concluding my words, THANK YOU\U0001f970\U0001f970\U0001f60b\U0001f4aa"
4,Dee Queen,1,"It is the app that I use most but Since the new update, I am unable to continue conversations with people calling; Their voice breaks poorly after a couple of seconds from receiving the call and they complain !! So annoying and drives me nuts and that makes me try other apps to talk to them !!! Hope this problem gets fixed fast. I have good internet connection."
5,Valent\xedn J. RdP,3,"It is lacking of tools to ""filter"" messages in group (or single) chats (BY A TIME PERIOD or messages from certain members of the group, etc), then, once filtered, select messages and delete or archive them. The only criterium is ""star"" or ""no star"" too poor!! It might be a sort of ""Advanced Search"", from date: dd-mm-yy1, to date: dd-mm-yy2, for contacts: contact1, contact2,contact_list... Otherwise, fine."
6,Anuj Verma,1,"1. ""Create one such option on WhatsApp. No individual person could send a call or message..Until we add that person to our contact list."" There is a reason for this..know one know send "" unknown links or message. 2. As such, there is an option in the phone, anonymous call and unknown message note send. Which will save the user's information and data."
7,Shan Shaheem PV,1,"Found a new bug. In status session, while you watching any status and closes it by swiping down, next or previous status is shown instead of closing. I talked with my friend and he too said the same problem. We both are using same phone brand(Realme 3 Pro). First I thought it's problem with my phone then same issue is reported by my friend. So please fix that bug. Thank you"
8,N K Sinha,1,"Since the last update, it has become total trash! Constantly keeps crashing and/or screen goes black for a sec and goes back to home screen. Can't type anything, nor can read messages or see statuses nor can call anyone. And from reading other updates I've come to know it's not my device's fault, but it's a huge bug since last update. Please fix it ASAP"
9,dipali patil,4,"I have a suggestion , you can make a update in which the person will say something and it will be written in letters .It will also save time of typing as in office we cannot hear the audio . If there is a message he can read it . Also many people cannot type very fast they need time .Here they can just say and it will convert into words .Thank you i think surely you will implement"
10,Anu Kumari,1,"I do have a great problem with this app nowadays. I updated this recently, and the new one is not good. The problem is that whenever we type or see a status it comes back to the home screen without giving any command. Developers its a request kindly fix it a ASAP. This app was very nice. it made our work easy!"
11,Alan,4,"Very nice app. I would like to have a feature also, you want to add a scroll button in the right side of group and individual chat as in Microsoft word. Because then I can easily scroll to the previous chats. Now it take too much time for me to see previous chats. I hope you will add this feature."
12,S Park,4,"Annoyed that the pop-up notification is no longer available on Android 10!!! This feature is really important to myself and many others, please return it to Android phones as we keep missing messages because of it!! At you should've asked consumers whether we wanted you to remove this feature! Really annoying!"
13,Shima Ra,1,"Most of the time, I cannot download and view files and documents sent to me a few days earlier. WhatsApp says those documents are not available in my phone memory. I have never encountered such issues with the Telegram messaging app. I am mostly using WhatsApp for business communication, but Telegram has proved much more reliable in keeping my messages organized and safe in cloud storage. Additionally, I do not like the fact that you can only use WhatsApp on only one device at a time."
14,Daniel Andrew Stevenson,4,VN had some bugs. Hope it doesn't happen again. I keep on updating but still the bug remains when I open the vn it bombs out and goes into silent mode. Have to keep on tapping the screen on home button to recover the vn. What else could be wrong? This is a galaxy A7 phone & it does reboot even when it busy with an app. Anyhow out there with some HELPFUL ADVICE?
15,Marina Labuschagne,3,"Since my whatsapp updated 9 hours ago my notification sounds are not working. The only alert I get that I have a new message is the vibrate sound. I have restarted my phone, switched it off completely, but nothing has changed. It is very frustrating. My husband has exactly the same problem!!!"
16,Niquel Bones,4,"***This issue has been fixed with the latest update, im still keeping this public for future reference tho*** Pretty sure this app causes a memory leak on older devices since the last update. It ends up saturating the RAM and the phone ends up restarting all active processes, which means the app crashes for a sec and if you were in the middle of writing a message well tough luck i hope youre ready to type it all again"
17,festy Omime,4,"WhatsApp has always been great, it gets even better but lately when I try to share photos or videos either to my contacts or status they seem cracked, like of poor quality, and my app is updated I don't know why, It happens with Samsung devices I've confirmed from 2 other persons, pls see to this.All in all WhatsApp is great, good work guys!!"
18,sunaina dalaya,1,"The worst experience thus far since the last update. Whatsapp keeps shutting down after a few seconds of opening it. At first I thought my phone was acting up, but I see from the reviews that others seem to be facing the same problem. This is a nightmare. If you don't fix this bug, your app is useless and might as well be uninstalled regardless of how useful it was in the past."
19,Lyah Dr,2,"Ok so... I updated my whatsapp and... it's just not working! At first, I tought it was my device or somerhing, but no! I've seen so many people complaining 'bout the same issue. My screen just go black and turn back to the home screen or it just exits by itself. Please fix this problem! I need to talk on whatsapp for my virtual classes... please fix this as soon as posible."
20,Wayne De France,3,"After the Sept 30, 2020 update, I can no longer download pictures and documents sent to me, however it indicates to the sender that I have reciever them by showing the 2 blue stars. I can send pictures and documents fine, others receive them. No fixes have worked so far."
21,TheRecommender,5,My experience with the app is good despite of the technical difficulties that can occur but is it possible to add more left handed emoticons and to bring back the revolver emoticon (if you want to). And is it possible to create something where users can add a custom track to their account so when their account is being viewed then the track they selected starts playing. And lastly can their story duration atleast be 45 seconds? Yours truly -Your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman
22,nilesh iwari,1,Dear sir always while trying to do backup my mobile phone shows error that if we are roaming we cannot backup chats. we need Wi-Fi for that. in general Wi-Fi is not available in India at most places. after coming of jio people are roaming and using the mob networks for using internet. as such request you to kindly change your policy in India and allow WhatsApp backup using internet data at roaming place as well. hope you take this in right spirit and do the necessary corrections at the earliest
23,Olaoluwa Ikuesan,4,"WhatsApp, it's been lagging of late, that's not even my displeasure. Can the developers please separate the groups from the personal messages? Like, they should be on different tabs, it really helps and makes navigation easier, saw it in a modified whatsApp, and Telegram has already adapted it. And, can we edit that ""WhatsApp"" at the top left of the app to our names?"
24,Abubakker Khan,1,"Since a week or so whatsapp started behaving strange. Calls or suddenly dropping off. When typing messages suddenly the keyboard dissapears and the chat closes. Very irritating. At first i thought it was my device acting up, but now i see others are experiencing the same issues. Come on whatsapp. Never had a single problem before. Pleas fix this asap. Thanks."
25,Lamia Hasan,1,"This app was pretty good since its last update, i have read others review also who are facing the same problem. I use it for educatoinal purpose so it is the most used app of mine. I use it in desktop also which is currently not working after update. I don' t know do the developer company really read these reviews or not, but I really don' t prefer this type of bizarre update, which causes silly problem\U0001f611"
26,Lisa McCauley,1,The WhatsApp signal is SHOCKING. I am unable to have a conversation for longer than 2 minutes without the person who I'm talking to being unable to hear me . I have been to my service provider . Done a sim swap . Restarted my phone and updated the app . All at my time and expense . It's usually brilliant . Please rectify this problem .
27,Mian Waqar khalil,1,"I am using samsung galaxyA21S device with all updated version of android and WhatsApp. I am facing an issue in viewing status.  Gernally, when we are viewing someone's stories, on taping screen the next story  opens and when we slide down the story menu get close. But here I am facing an issue, When I slide down on screen, instead of closing of stories, the next story automatically run. This is very disturbing thing.  Please make it perfect"
28,Ashish Choudhari,4,The app is best no objection But I want to use it on multiple phones because of my work and this should happen by a code type. A particular priority first phone should have real app account and other is like we should enter a password and first we should give the permission frm one phone and we can see how many places the same account is active so it can be the whole privacy .
29,Mouli Chandar Pandurangan,1,I'm not getting any notifications from the app after changing my phone.. Mine is a new android phone (android 10). After switching the phone I'm not able to create notifications with sound or with popup.. I tried all the settings in my phone and couldn't do anything. The notifications options itself is not working in the app. Help me to get the notifications.
30,Jana Ahmed,3,It is an good app i always use it for everything but sometimes if i left the massage for allot of time it tells me to ask the sender to resend it!! Plus that we cant call( just like a shape) ! And adding to this when i hear the voice massages it sometimes close the mobile and stop and when i try to open it again it does the same ! Please fix these problems.
31,Will Iam,1,"This is the most hororble update ever, @ the middle of message writing it will shut down automatically, every time i have to repeat my message writing up to 5-10times after i can send my message to the recipients. I tried uninstall&install the whatsapp, but the issue is still there. Even 1 star rating is not deserve for this useless new update, it is not helpful for us whatsapp user. But no choice, otherwise this comment couldn't send without hitting the star rating. Please fix this immediately."
32,Zo\xeb Visser,1,"Since I updated WhatsApp a few days ago, while scrolling it freezes. Eg. When checking who viewed your status, you can scroll freely then suddenly you can't scroll up or down. This also happens with the camera when you want to swipe up to see other images in your gallery. And sometimes when watching a video on someone's status, it won't let you pause by ""tapping and holding"" the screen. As soon as you do, it skips the video. As you can imagine this is incredibly frustrating."
33,Miriam Hernandez-Rivero,2,"Sometimes (often) I don't get notifications until I open the app. Also (not a complaint just my opinion)I wish the delete message would disappear I don't know why ppl enjoy sending something and delete it, at least make an option like the ""last sern"" you can have it or not"
34,Ji Josie,1,It says my phone has problem with time zone and forced me to adjust it. I did so in setting but not work at all. I uninstall the app and re download again hope it would solve the problem however sadly this time they got me frustrated more. I can't receive verification code and gradually they limit me to resend code or call to verify up to 17 hrs\uff01\uff01
35,Annabel Grace,3,Can you make some updates which are more user friendly and current?  For example: It would be really great if you could add a feature to switch notifications off - on slack they have don't disturb option.  The message has been delivered and then the person will respond when less busy or available?
36,yones E,3,"You're just rolling out new updates every time but nothing changes. You really need to change and improve some features. For instance, if I delete my account, nothing happens to my previous messages on my contacts' WhatsApp account. They won't see that I've deleted my account and they may message me. Also, DO NOT use Google to store the messages, we really need to store every single message on WhatsApp itself. One of my friends, Majid, has suggested the idea."
37,Alexandru-Eusebiu Biolete,2,"Pretty hideous app, not gonna lie. The design is basically the same since the first release with very small improvements over the years. I don't really understand the business strategy behind it. They were trying to implement ads, but for the moment they've abandoned this, leaving that useless status feature. Unless they wanted that metadata, most likely it was bought just to adopt its technologies in Facebook's other products. I'm using it just because I have to, since most people are on it."
38,Aliens Vlog,2,Hey WhatsApp... You need to improve your interface. When we bring our phone to ear to hear the voice message the call buttons getting activated and its making calls. I think you need to think about this and make some changes in your user interface. By the way I am not using WhatsApp nowadays that much and was thinking to delete my account too.
39,Harsh Rathore,3,"It is a very useful app, but the only problem in this app is that the storage path can not be changed from internal storage to sd card as this app is covering large storage space of your internal storage (that is very limited) I request the developers to please set an option to set the default storage path to sd card in the future updates. Hope that developers will take care of this and will respond to me..."
40,David Figo,3,"What's happening to this app recently, when you want to make video calls and voice calls, it very slow to connect even when you have a good network connection, secondly when you post videos on status the video is more faster than the voice by making the clip looks funny when viewing, please admin should work on this issues. Thanks"
41,Ch. Rashmi Rekha Patro,5,"I am happy with the app. I would like to suggest something. During video calls, it's difficult to control babies. With excitement, they tap anywhere on the screen. So please give a child lock button as available in many video players so that tapping anywhere on the screen becomes dysfunctional until unlocked. Hope you consider this."
42,Sitanshu Mondal,4,Good app. Need to add more features. Add 'proxy settings' option for any types of internet connection. Add 'mobile number hide' option. Add 'edit' option for status as well as messages. Add 'add account' feature so that more than one account can be used in one device. This is very much important. Add atleast 3 customised status privacy option so that I can change status privacy immediately.
43,Islam 360,4,"Although seems good , but I request the administrator to update the app again . And in this update , we can easily edit the chat and we should also enlarge the size of the text or small it . And there should be a polling system on WhatsApp group . Cause I have a kind of group that involves polling . These are the few new functions that should be added to WhatsApp , So that whatsapp can work properly . Waiting for the new update soon . ""Thanks for the time"""
44,Derek Davies,2,"The status update has a bug. It demands access to the camera to be able to add a status update. If you deny it, you are not allowed to the next stage. Even though the next step is to take a photo OR choose one from your gallery. No camera access is required to load images from the gallery. The permission should be asked for only when you choose to take a photo."
45,Melinas World,5,"Amazing! You can text your friends or family, send voice chat, call or FaceTime them. No scam at all. I also like how you can upload a status and check who called. I've been using it for 2 years and it's great. I also love how you can block or send emojis or change the background and your profile pic. Your info is also private! THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!"
46,Bhavesh Shah,3,"After update when using share option it only shows individual and Group details, doesn't show broadcasts created. So now after update if i have multiple broadcasts created then can't share anything as broadcast doesn't reflect in the sharing list and need to share individually gettinf into each and every broadcast. Too much annoying. Please look into it."
47,Ashok Kr,1,"Writting here as there is no option to send massage (problem) to app developer. Dear Whatsapp Team, I often use whatsapp, mean whenever someone sends message in 15 to 30 days. So usually I restrict mobile data as your app consume data automatically approx 50-70 MB, even not in use. But what I found that your app automatically starts mobile data next day in my device setting and starts consuming data, that means it disturb or overwrite my device system or setting. Please resolve."
48,exaverio dafa,1,Im realizing im not the only one facing problems with the new version of whatsApp. Frozen screens and blank black screens. Cant finish typing a message before it kicks you out. Whats going on and are you going to fix this annoying feature and how soon. This is my second day of endless frustrations and its deeply annoying.
49,Kashif Naeem,1,The pop-up messages are disabled and cannot be enabled. They say that your android version does not support it. I have the latest version of Android i.e. 10 but it is still saying your version of Android does not support pop-up notification. I am really tired of this issue. Do something about it.
50,Zoey Burrell,2,Had the app for years and loved it but since the update it no longer notifies me when I have messages. It says in the app settings that my device is no longer eligible for that service. It's a samsung galaxy A10!!! Not eligible. Annoying as I depend on it alot as my network signal is bad and therefore do most of my communication through the internet. Nothing wrong with my phone but now have to buy a new one because the developers have decided to fold over the ones who cant afford \xa3200 phones.
51,Nickalos Daley,4,Whatsapp is awesome but we all are having this one huge problem... Whenever we post a status the quality literally vanishes! Like you post a nice picture with good quality but when its uploaded all that good quality is gone please can you do something about this... 🙏💯 Would be greatly appreciated.
52,jean linedo Delpe,5,That was great. I manage to stay in contact with all my friends thanks to thus app. I think ou is good to have such as everywhere and everyone must download it. It is easier to stay in touch with friend using such app.
53,Akash Reddy,4,"Hello! one small inconvinence is, when i uninstall and install the app. backing up chats work 2 ways, 1. From google drive 2. From copied backupfiles and images, vids. from old mobile to this one. To backup from offline internal storage, you first have to remove the google account and then sign in into the newly installed wattsapp. otherwise, it directly goes into downloading backup from google drive instead( instead of even bothering to check in offline files). Fix! it! Give me a choicethen"
54,Heliodor No.1,4,"This app is great but, WHY IS THERE A TIME LIMIT FOR WHAT YOU CAN DELET! This is really good and it is great for talking to friends and family but when I have a message I only just regret sending I can't delet it, there is a way to delet old messages, but the hack doesn't work on my phone. There is one more thing, why is there a delet for me, cause when I delet something for me by accident, it is impossible to recover unless you do this extremely complicated algorithm."
55,G MAHESWARAPPA,1,Very good messenger application. But there are some serious issues. Mainly the received photos images will display well for some days. Later they are not accessible. Only a blurred image is shown. This is a major high priority issue. Many important needed photos are getting missed because of this bug. Requesting for the best solution or a workaround soon.
56,Tris Bruce,2,"I can no longer send long messages on my Samsung Galaxy S mini because after just one or two lines of text the screen freezes and then closes, cancelling everything I have just written. It's extremely annoying. Now I am forced to write short phrases and quickly send them before the screen-freeze. Please take us back to the previous version, which worked OK."
57,Entertainment Desk Dbs Asaba,1,"This should have been a perfect app. However, the fingerprint privacy option can leave a user locked out on their own device. Once fingerprints have failed (as they often do), there are no options for a user to use a code to open back this app . Even if it was the verification code . Its frustrating how the app continuously has amnesia for my own fingerprint after a while . Compelling me to uninstall and reinstall the app every now and again ."
58,Tam Vo,1,"WhatsApp have always worked fine. Just now that the voice record function is being increasingly used by my contacts and Whatsapp still haven't fixed the too low volume issue when recording, it is getting annoying to use WhatsApp. If you have a function available in your application, then ensure you test it and make it work properly. I have Android Oxygen 10, so it shouldn't be a problem for my phone."
59,Nej Gnol,1,"Exepriencing serious issues with the lastest update on the Google Pixel 2, the microphone/speaker no longer works correctly. I cannot hear the other person on calls and the other person cannot hear me. This I am unable to place voice calls, video calls and also sending voice notes. When playing received voice notes, the message plays for 3 seconds and freezes for 6 and so it goes for the whole message."
60,fitzroy davis,1,"Ever since they updated in September I'm having problems especially when I'm typing a message, the screen freezes and then disappear and comes back again at that point I have to start the message all over again. I used to love whatsapp but now it really gets on my nerves! Hopefully you'll be able to fix it very soon! !!"
61,Ezra Gaming,4,"Actually, I use WhatsApp and I just want to suggest a new feature: There should be themes for chat bubbles so it looks more attractive and there should be More themes rather than dark and light,, There should be themes so you could control the brightness of dark and light theme, And there can be added color themes also, If possible\u0964\u0964 And thanks for working hard in WhatsApp and A huge like to all the members."
62,Annalisa Llinares,1,"What the f%*k is going on?? I updated the app on my Android phone about 3 days before the previous version expired. Since then I've had endless notifications that the app was out of date. Tried to update again but it sat ""waiting for download"" for about 2 hours. I uninstalled and then tried to reinstall but nothing's happening. It's still not getting past ""waiting for download"". Please respond. I need this to video call my mother overseas and had no issues with the last version. Not happy!"
63,Cosmas Thenya,1,Just got my phone fixed and was setting up my account when I realized that my offline backup is now useless. I switch phones regularly and I've never had this problem before. Why can't I restore my messages from my offline backup like before?
64,Harsh Chordia,4,Very bad experience after the last update... Frame drops are common I can not use whatsapp for more than 20 sec . I used to love the app the kind of free message and video by now useless app. I hope facebook solve the problem quickly!!!!!!!
65,Infotechz,1,"Yup, this is the most... WORST messenger app ever I can say. Reason? My friend looted into my phone number in his whatsapp, I was not able to log in again in my whatsapp using my number. When he logged out, and when I logged in, my all chats, messages were DELETED. Why is that? All my memories, all my work photos, all my class notes which used be sent online, DELETED. I backed up them a month ago, I tried to restore those messages, and, they still were absent. Please I say, don't install this."
66,Doreen Balwantsingh,3,This app was working great until the recently update...now if i am busy on the phone doing anything...i don't get incoming call notifications or message notifications... whenever i open the app i see miss call or message..Please help! Fix the problem...Thank you !!
67,Obadiah Lamshwa Lamare,3,"Since the latest update (I updated WhatsApp on 27th September 2020), there have been many problems. The App takes a long time to open, then there are times when the screen suddenly turns black, then there is that annoying 'Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped' message. DEVELOPERS PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I SEE MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS!!! THANK you"
68,Marymagdalene Onome,1,This app has lost its vibe. It keeps shutting down on me. I can't video call or audio call without the app crashing. I keep losing the chats I spent minutes typing already prepared to send. This started when i first updated my whatsapp. I uninstalled and installed again. Nothing has changed. Please do something about it. It is really affecting everything I do.
69,Joshua adeyemo,4,"My upload to google drive settings is on weekly but it occurs daily, . It exhausts up my 70gb data earlier than it should. I had to change it to monthly to get some peace of mind and reasonable budget allocation on data subscription. But my backup is at risk.."
70,Its_ Galaxy_Sky,1,"Okay so im not the only one who is having a hard time using whatsapp after the latest update, I was using it normaly and then the screen went black and then whatsapp crashed, I barely use whatsapp! I can't see anybody's status, I can't put anything in my status because whatsapp is crashing all the time, I can't text my friends because when I text them thr screen goes black and then I have to redo my whole messagw again! Please fix this stupid bug or do something about it!"
71,Jose Rasta,2,I have used whatsapp for many years but this time am not happy with the new update. I used it For puting my video status in any minutes and hours but this time is very dissapointing because i can not add a video status which goes for more than 30 second pliz fix this very soon. It was my best app but i think it is going to be the worst if this things continue.
72,Jason Rodrigues,2,"It is annoying when people unnecessarily are sending you promotional messages over whatsapp. Add a feature with the following functions :- 1. An option to unsubscribe from a person's broadcast list. 2. If someone adds us in their broadcast list we must know the reason and have the choice to opt into it or not. Kindly, Do something with regard to the Broadcast feature. Everyone is promoting their products and business to people without their permission."
73,Taruna Hemnani,4,It's an excellent app!! Just two suggestions. 1] There are people who keep a check on our last seen and visit our walls multiple times a day. Can you please make a provision to see the number of times one has opened our walls. 2] Why don't we do this that the last seen which one sees of other person is actually the last time that person visited his wall. That'll be better. And just to add if only that person with whom we chat can see us online and rest all the respective last seens. Please reply
74,Harith Hilmi,5,Overall its good. I've been using it since 5 years back. But i think the time for higher quality for image at image and status has arrive(I'm using android and i don't know for ios). Maybe developer can make option for the users to choose either they want to use high quality image(with more internet used) or normal image. But overall its good. I'm appreciate your team good work. Thank you.
75,Vexx_ _X_,4,"This app is good! But, one thing that doesn't have in this app.... It doesn't have a security mode..... That's what make this app feel unsafe... I really want to give this app five star but since it doesn't have security mode.... I will give it only four star..... Good job! And one more thing. It's take a lot of space to load a video and a picture."
76,Prachi D,1,"New update of September sucks!! I have been using WhatsApp on Pixel2xl, with Android 11! And since the new update, the camera, has a lag like Samsung phones!! And weird glitch of keyboard on search of names, it crashes quite often. Please do something about this."
77,Murugan Manoharan,5,"The latest update on this app is not feeling little good. On the status page if we scroll down, the media playing, will get cancelled and goes to the status updates. But now, it skips into the next media, and sometimes the interface gots stucked. Please rework on it, and fix the issue. I don't know how many of you've noticed this problem from the recent update."
78,Inderaj Tech,5,It's a great app Just few things for which we have to choose others app. 1. Add more pin options because in today world we have so many unwanted group and contact. So if add more pin we can see our important msg on top. 2. When new members are added to group they can't see old messages. Add an update so that in group old messages are visible to new members. 3. Do something so that we can send big videos. Of any GB any length.
79,Gershon Forde,5,"Just a suggestion: I have noted that sometimes group members post spam or other inappropriate media in the group spaces. Can you add a feature that allows administrators to remove offensive posts from group chat threads? This would be helpful in the event that child pornography or fake news is posted to the platform. Also, Telegram seems to be outpacing this platform by adding nifty features to the application while WhatsApp seems...well stagnated."
80,Manena Chifupa,1,"Ever since I updated the latest version ,I can barely stay on whstsapp for more than two minutes without getting the ""unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped working, report or close"" message and it just goes off. I've tried everything I could possible try starting from reporting, rebooting,restarting, freeing up a whole chunk of my memory by deleting stuff, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing seems to work work and this has gone on for 2 days! It's so frustrating and inconveniencing\U0001f620"
81,Priya Natesh,1,"I could have rated this app 5 stars but I gave 1... The reasons are: Whatsapp crashes on my Android 4.4.4 phone almost every 1 minute, so I backed up my Whatsapp data and reset my whole phone and reinstalled it... I tried to restore my data back and from September 5th to september 30th data was not backed up and it is lost. Please improve..."
82,Dharmik Kabra,4,"I have one feed back thats please give us option inside whatsapp about which number we want to sync and which we dont, it happens many times that you want certain person phone number for professional purpose and you save it, but then they are added to your whatsapp and that is an issue, we have to mute their story and they add us to their broadcast list, request you to look into this"
83,Sathwik,1,"I don't know why my chat backup on google drive will be too slow sometimes even though I have 50Mbps connection. Only sometimes it will upload in full speed. I have googled on that issue, found that it might be problem with google or whatsapp servers."
84,DeadGazeS,1,"Wow. Half of the year passed and the bug I reported in march is still in the app. I don't get it. Fix it, it's annoying. In March it was on my s10e now it is on my s10 (europe version). Everytime I want to send a picture WhatsApp just rotates the picture(s) automatically. It's really annoying and u could have fixed it after 6 months. Just fix it, please."
85,Elona Hoxha,4,"It is a really nice app, I use it all the time, the only concern is that after you left a group chat 2 or more times, but you want to go back at that group a couple hours later, I'll have to wait like 1 day or more, other than that it is very good, hope that whatsapp listens to this and finds a way to fix this problem"
86,Victor Nwaneri,3,"There seems to be a serious deviation from the norm. WhatsApp now has issues with smooth working. During a call, assuming it is on speaker, as soon as the screen goes off the other party stops hearing you until you wake the screen up again. For long calls that is painful. On Video calls, if you receive a normal cell phone call this cuts out the volume and there is no option to pit the call on speaker save to cut the call and dial again. This is happening on Android 10 version 2.1"
87,preethi priya,1,From yesterday itself. I cannot upload any status . My internet connection is too good. Why this is like that I don't know. Any videos cannot upload to status. Kindly clear my issues. Otherwise I will delete the whatsapp. Nowadays WhatsApp is too bad. Not working properly. Waiting for your response. Already I posted one review but now it is not here. You guys are deleting my review right that I don't know. Clear my issues.
88,Corina Sierra,2,There so many kinks that need to be ironed out with the new update... 1. Poor quality of videos taken from phone camera and uploaded to status ... 2. The length of video only limited to 30s in status... 3. When I'm on video call and get a regular phone call...the volume on video call goes mute or very low... 4. Add a request button...have an option to accept or decline
89,Dolan Trump,1,"There has been some problem recently regarding the audio of voice and video calls from Samsung phones to iPhones. Audio couldn't be heard both in voice and video calls between my samsung phone and iphone of a friend. We have tried checking the app settings, clearing data and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I could not find a soulution.Between androids, there is no problem. Kindly resolve and see to it sooner. Thank you."
90,Jasmanpreet Singh,1,Its a very nice app and I have used this app for 5 years ! But now since the last update I have been facing many problems with this app . When I chat with my friends suddenly the screen freezes and I come to the home page of the app and then again the screen freezes and I come the home screen of my phone . I request whatsapp to do something about this matter.
91,MASELOBE NTLATLANE,5,"WhatsApp has been a great messenger so far.. it had really helped me text everything that's text-able\U0001f31d. Thank you a lot. If it's not against your policy, can we get a feature that indicates when people have blocked us or not... as getting those 1 black tick it's such a turn off... and a bit misleading coz we aren't sure if it's network problems or maybe you're actually blocked. I don't know, because it's kindah confusing if we should try again texting them back or not. Thank you in advance."
92,Abhishek Abhi,5,I like this app. But you should keep a feedback option to understand your user experience and expectation. And you should also keep any mark to help the user to know that he is online. And also keep a option if the user wants others to know that he is online or not. I have a problem sometimes I can't see the person is online even he is online
93,aniruddha bhattacharyaa,5,Absolutely amazing experience. It's getting better day by day. Bring more amazing and astonishing versions of this app with amazing new features. Add on more and more amazing stuff so that it becomes the best messenger app of our generation. And also enhance it's existing features as well. Bring more and more features with advanced versions of everything that exists in this app.
94,Anthony Canham,1,My phone keeps on freezing and switches off whilst i am typing. It's really frustrating. Since the latest update my phone just go black and switches off. I can only type 2 to 3 words them the screen go black and back to the home page. It's very frustrating and so annoying. Please fix this problem urgently. It's really not nice to chat on whatsapp a more with this problem
95,Gacha- Netflix,2,"I really don't like the new version, when you do a group call, WhatsApp keeps muting my friends or me, whenever we talk. The voice messages need now even more time to load even tho my Wi-fi connection is perfectly fine. The camera is litterally not taking photos, I need to klick at least 4 times 'til it tales 1 picture. I miss the old version so badly!"
96,Akanksha Nidhi,2,"I don't know what the problem is with WhatsApp but after every 3 or 4 days all the chats of my account get lost and a message appears saying all the data got deleted, tap to restore. When I try to restore all the chats heads do appear but without any messages. Then I have to re install it 2 or 3 times before I get all of my messages back. Please update the app or do something about this issue."
97,Simile Mishra,2,"WhatsApp must add more privacy options in which one can hide their profile picture with particular contact they don't want to share their story, status or last seen. Or they can add option of directly texting new one on whatapp without saving their contact number. Because WhatsApp is used for so many purposes like sharing anything on WhatsApp other than mail and sometimes as being a girl we don't want to share our profile picture to anyone (vendor or unknown)."
98,Shae Garridigan,1,"It was working fine until the new update. I cant view anyones status without the screen going black and whatsapp exiting. The worst problem is that whenever i want to chat to someone the keyboard disapears, my phone freezes, the screen just goes black and then Whatsapp just exits. I have not been able to talk to anybody. Please fix this annoying bug. Thanks in advance."
99,Sadaqat Karim sk,5,What's app is very useful app for students. It connect students with their teachers and classmates which help the students to communicate with them and share there problems regarding education. It also have many other benefits but as a student I find the above benefit very furitful for learners. During this corona pendemic I used WhatsApp to connect with my teachers and continue my education. It all happened just because of this app. THANKS WHATSAPP!!!
100,Shivkumar B,3,"I backup my messages on WhatsApp monthly to Google drive. Since the last update the back up feature has been buggy. It always reaches 99% completion and then rolls back to a random number in the 60s although the notification popup still shows that 99% of the back up is done. I've tried clearing my cache, updating my android OS but nothing fixed the problem. I'm afraid to reinstall WhatsApp as my messages in the past month aren't backed up and I'm afraid I may lose them. Please fix this problem."
101,levins durai,2,Have lots of issues after the android 11 update. I can't get back from the status screen and can't send the message through the notification. I thought I sent that reply to that message but that was not sent to the receiver. When I open the app again then the app send my message to the respective guy \U0001f644... Like this have lots of problems on it. Please check your app with Android 11 support

103,Abdulai Kamara,4,"WhatsApp is a very good and advanced app which aids better communication... But what am suggesting is for users to be able to select who would see their profile picture. Also, I suggest a room be created for more people for voice and video calls... Also, can the management or/and developers please find a way to increase the number of persons per group...??...This is important taking into consideration in the instances of School Groups, organizations and more... Thanks"
104,Shubham Rajput,1,Since the last update the app is not working well. The keyboard disappears and the screen goes black and the app exits by itself. If I was busy typing something it also disappears and then I must start again. And other times the app freezes. Please fix this problem! I see many people are complaining about the same problem!
105,Marian,2,"The groups chat are in the same panel with the persons chat. The status tab is useless and waste of space. I can't copy an part of the message. The call sound is worse and has some beeps in the background sometimes. Why needs to duplicate the contacts. No way to make to receive a invitation if someone adds you to a group. You can't even disable the Groups notification from android settings, keeps reactivating."
106,Ever Mercadal,2,"Really the best is Telegram. This apps makes more space. This app is not-based on cloud. Needs Google Drive to upload things. I don't find privacy. Can't clean cache, because deletes important content. Only the good things are the calls, end-to-end message encryption and status, but all the rest are bad. Please, be more good like Telegram."
107,Arul Prakasar,3,Hi. For the past few hours I think whatsapp calls are not working. If there is an incoming or outgoing call we can't hear each other. We tried few times and it's still the same. Whatsapp has to take some serious action on this because people are using social media often in their daily life and it will be difficult when 1 of the features is not been working properly.
108,Ankan Chakraborty,2,"This upfate of whats app is closing automatically in my htc phone. I have using whats app on this phone since 2015. First time it happened.

It's really annoying. I'm sure I'm not the only person with this issue."
111,Alina R.,1,"This is my first review on Play ever. I have been using WhatsApp since 2014 and - maaan - what have you done to the App in the last update (September 17, 2020) that it is literally impossible to use it?? I can not type more than 3 words, the app freezes and jumps back to the contact list, I had to be inventive and write messages with the simplest Notes app(!!) and quickly paste it in WhatsApp, I can not listen to the audio messages (freezes and jumps back), can not record mine longer than some seconds etc etc. I've even tried the ""deleting-reinstalling"" for the first time since 2014. Didn't help. We need a new update without bugs or roll it back, urgently."
112,Micah Brown,1,"Ever since the update it has been crashing every time I open it. The app will just close by itself while i look at status, record voice notes, or even when i have it just there open it wont even back up my messages anymore, please fix this issue. I know im not the only one experiencing this problem. This began happening when the update was done approx, two days before today."
113,Ehsan samimipour,1,It's an aweful app; other side sees when you delet your massage ; it doesn't have any cloud storage like telegram; it doesn't have app for iPad; you can't have your massage on each of your devices like telegram;only one device it supports ; it's security is great ; but why should be so worried about security?

115,diwakar deo,5,"Great app. In these corona times, the app is a lifesaver as our school is connected through and largely dependent on whatsapp communications. I had a suggestion for improvement though which would help me work effectively. When I add a shortcut of a group to the homescreen, I am unable to see a message received notification on the shortcut icon. If that is done, it would help me immensely as I would not require to go to the main app and comb through different groups. Thank you"

120,Thomas George,3,"Since the last update, the app has been showing some bugs. While swiping down to close a status, it just skips to the next one or plays the audio in background.

125,Richard Kline,3,"This is a good app, but it won't be great until you can have it on more than one device at a time. I had it on my phone, but I spend about 90% of my time on my tablet so I moved it. The problem is about 30% of the time I use this app I'd like it to be on my phone. I was added to a group. I turned off the sound for notifications and it keeps turning the sound back on. If this doesn't change I'm going to leave the group because it is annoying to constantly hear notifications."

Please Can This be Done away with, or at least have an option to decide if you want Autoplay or play when you push play."

129,SweetCorn,1,"Hey WhatsApp! I have a few problems about your app. First of all, since the new update I keep getting kicked out of largly populated groups and other normal chats too. My keyboard disappears, then my whole screen goes black! My only suggestion is, if we delete our abouts we shouldn't have to reinstall the app to get them back! We should be able to restore all previous abouts, right?"
130,Bushra Bi,5,"I love this App. Its the only calling/messaging app I use. Can u please add new features? For example.. while video calling if someone takes a screenshot, u get notified immediately with the screenshot coming directly in your chat. Also if anyone takes screenshot of ur status, u get notified the same way with the message popping up in the chat. Can u please add this feature so we know when anyone takes screenshots of our video calls/status? Thank you :)"
131,Sukhim,4,"I found a one problem while using Watsapp that is, when we we're trying to send a photos by converting to a DOC but it only consist one photo to a document or PDF if you give an option where we can compile a numbers of photos to a one DOC or in the form of PDF it will be easier to students, office workers and others. If this option is available on Watsapp then we don't have to download another app for PDF converter/ compilation of several photos to one document or PDF. Thank you Regards Bipin"
132,Rukmani Desikan,1,Every few days asking to up date but then requires lot of additional space to do so. It should try to up date with minimum additional space requirement The app should find means to improve in that diection. Why does it happen only on this phone. While such requirement up date is not Happening in other phones.?????!!!!!

134,Mashayach,4,"App is great. Bt 1 thing i would like, is the ability to delete a message ""For everyone"" at anytime! That option is limited, I'm not sure why, bt it would be good to delete ur own text for everyone at anytime always. & maybe add more filter options on status post 2 be more creative with the things we post \U0001f937\U0001f3fe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. & can even add an option to have ur status seen by anyone tht has WhatsApp, without necessarily having their contact info without being able 2 contact them unless permission given."
135,Akshat Jindal,1,I have been raising the complaint so many times regarding the issue with the voice messages playing by default in call rather than speakers on samsung S10. And you guys keep on asking to share screenshot. Do you have any brains. How will my screenshot help you show the issue. I have even sent you a screen recording but you guys won't respond. Are you ever going to solve this bug or not. Samsung says the bus is with whatsapp app as it works fine in other apps.
136,MARK COLASSO,3,It's an awesome app for communication. But ever since its last update I don't what has happened to this app. If I start to text someone the keyboard just disappears and it goes back and there also a problem with status switching if I want exit from status it just shows me the next persons status.

Now I'm just pissed cos I'll be viewing status or typing a message and in the middle, it says whatsapp has stopped and it loads again by itself and I have to start again. It literally has a timeline of 3mins I can be on the app. No other app does this and they are all updated too. Instagram works fine."
138,koso panty,1,"This was literally my go to app for calling overseas. As of lastnight when I call my partner on WhatsApp we can't hear each other AT ALL and it's only when i we call each other. when we call other contacts on WhatsApp we can hear each other. For some weird reason it only does this when i call my partner. We've reset our phones, we've both delete the app and got it back and still the same result. very disappointed \U0001f61e"
139,Ishwah Akram,1,Since i updated the version the camera is not working. Every time it says camera failed when i take a picture. Moreover the voice and video calling quality has been destroyed completely. It's creating a mess. Kindly fix it as soon as possible or give an option to return to the previous version
140,latest gist,3,Amazing...I will have given it a five but because it does not have some features i feel will not only cause an increase in whatsapp users but also fund more money for the brains behind WhatsApp.... how about including a live video features whereby all my contacts list gets a notification just like Instagram does.....i will also like an update on last seen features....whereby i can hide my last seen from a particular person or a particular set of people not the whole of my contacts list....
141,mahesh kumar,2,I am not sure whether the latest update is causing this problem or not. When my phone screen goes dark in the middle of a voice call then the other party cant hear anything I speak. I have to keep the phone active that too on this app. If this is one of the new feature they have added then its too bad.
142,Natasha Gray,5,The app is very nice. I wish you guys would come up with something new for example: When a contact sends a message or emoji to avoid replying back. We could simple double tap the message and it automatically indicate that we like the message with a ❤. Instead of replying back.

The following problem only happens with Whatsapp (not with Skype, Telegram, etc. nor with regular calls): I'm in the middle of a call with no issues and all of the sudden I notice the other person (being the caller or the receiver of the call) stops hearing me at all. I have to hang up and call again. THIS IS VERY ANNOYING!!! I've tried with different headsets, old and new, wired or bluetooth but the problem remains. The moment I'm sure most of my contacts are available in another platform, I will stop using Whatsapp. TERRIBLE!!! (since acquired by FB)"

Please solve this..........."
148,Yuichiro Hyakuya,4,Well it's better tha other chatting apps..It's easy and convenient to use..As well as we can share images and files make groups see how people update their status etc..The only problem is that while sending and receiving file it slowly eats up your internal storage and slowly reaches the app size to GB which slows down the device for certain operations..

Allow us listen to voice notes as an audio file rather than a voice call format that would make it be affected when you block the call sensor."

153,Ashutosh Deaf,5,"I have noticed that Whatsapp Messenger notifications come up similar to how Facebook Messenger notifications are delivered - with a chat head. This is a circle with the messenger's profile picture showing, and clicking on it opens a small window with the message shown.

In first I think that it's my phone problem but after that I know that this problem is coming from my all the phones. When we use whatsapp its quit automatically. Now a days my exam is going on and I am facing a lot lot of problems with this worse app. Now a days many schools are using whatsapp for their online study and all students face problems because of this app and I also. So make this app correct otherwise I'll delete this
159,Lei lo,3,"It would be nice for the autobackup feature to be optional (or allow a manual choice for backup times etc) so my phone doesn't autobackup on low space and completely erase all of my messages. This has happened several times now, before i could make space to back up and i keep losing highly important messages for classes etc because it just chooses to delete everything without my permission. Please, look into the potion of allowing users to choose their backup time instead of forcing one at 2 am."
160,KRISH GAMING,4,I'll rate this app 4 star because when I tried to send a video it always keeps telling me retry retry and after 4-5 retry the video is sent half and approximately after 45 mins the video is sent and the downloading of the video is also very slow please fix this problem otherwise it is a great app for communication.
161,Pamula Jacob,2,"Whenever I open the app, it is being stuck and the home button ad the power button are also not working. I have to take the battery off and put the battery back and onn it again. This is very disgusting. Other than that the app is very good in everything. Better if there is dark mode. My device is Samsung galaxy grand prime"
162,Emma Kerubo,1,"This app is terrible since i updated it the screen goes off n on . When im typing or doing a voice note, the screen goes of n its not once or twice nooo.. its every time i type or call or doing voice note and its very annoying because you have to repeat typing n typing .please do something about this because its arritating i swear."
163,Steven,1,I've recently acquired a Samsung S20 Ultra. The notifications are not working as they did before on my Samsung S8 Plus which was a lower version of Android. These include the lighting notifications when I receive texts. This is on Android 10. I've reinstalled and done all the settings but still nothing works. Adding to this calls are consistently cut even with good WiFi and mobile signals.
164,Aashish jha,3,"It's nice app, i've been using it from last 5 years , but since the last update , it is crashing automatically , a 23 Mb app takes 700-800 mb space in ram and the highest usage of cpu upto 52%. What the hell you did in last update screen frezess just in 30 sec and after that things remain standstill till it don't restart , we want whatsapp team to fix it as soon as possible ..."
165,Zia B,1,WhatsApp is draining my phone battery rapidly \U0001f611 especially on a video call that lasted an Hour and a half it drained 45 percent which is crazy. Have uninstalled it and then reinstalled let's hope it behaves now. The platform generally also is glitchy to use. I'm enduring the troublesome app due to work requirements. Not a fan! Kindly fix and resolve the challenges faced by users especially the Battery drain issue. Thanks \U0001f64f\U0001f3fb
166,samir undirwade,2,"Update in review, Now \U0001f447problem is resolved and the second problem have come with status viewer, it means WhatsApp is not gone work without having some problems. \U0001f92c \U0001f449When I try to reply from notification panel, phone quickly restarts, while other apps like fb massanger are working well. I always have any problem with this app, one goes and second comes."
167,Meena Shekh,5,"It is good and nice app because it helps to communicate with contracts persons. It helps to send file like a photos and information. We talk in WhatsApp with the help of voice, massage and video call in this aap. You shared video to contracts persons. The WhatsApp provide many facilities in this app you can enjoy the aap. This aap use in all over the world because it is important every person's. It is very low mb aap not effect of hang on your mobile phone. And another things it is system its nc"
168,9D09 Harshvardhan Chavan,3,The app is good for chit-chat but the thing that made me to improve this app is that see I will give you a example: If you have send me a pdf if 1 to 2 pages and you know that I have received it by the double blue ticks. But you don't know that I have really opened the pdf and see what you have send. You understand na? So plz try to improve this And one. More reason is that we can't send file more than 100mb it's a big problem for me. So plz try to improve this also.
169,Isla Cassidy,4,"This is an AMAZING app. U can text people and u don't get random calls or texts for anyone u don't know apart from people that have ur number and u don't have theirs. The reason why I only gave 4 \U0001f31f is cos it does take a while to send things to people that r far away or in a different country. Sometimes the call connection is bad to if they're only round the corner which is frustrating. It also only sends texts if u have WiFi connection or mobile data which I dont. Overall a great app, get it!!"
170,Kabyasree Hazarika,1,"We are getting updates daily but nothing really seems to change... I'm facing major problems in the smooth working of the app... since the last few days the app shuts on it's own... i cant open few chats, like it takes a really long time to open a particular chat and a lot more issues... please fix the problems as early as possible."
171,Sof\xeda,1,"I have a problem with WhatsApp, since it began the September I can't write, read or listen an audio or video without show me a message "" WhatsApp keeps stopping"" each 2 minutes or less. If I already restarted, installed and uninstalled the application more than 7 times and I cannot perform the backup. Please solve this ""problem"""
172,Az Yusop,1,"Since the latest update, this apps give me so much headache..the apps crashes frequently..and the most annoying part is when i am typing the words, the apps suddenly freeze and goes blank..all the words i typed dissappeared..come on developer...do something about it..!! Im not gonna change the rating if this issue is still not solve!"
173,Shubham Soni,1,"I'm giving one star rating because they don't resolve problems. Since my last two updates my media visibilty has been set to no by default. I had to change it for all my contacts to yes, it was really frustrating as well as irritating to do that for nearly 600 contacts. \U0001f624 Please WhatsApp look into this, what is the reason behind such issue."
174,Nitin Shetye,3,Please add on feature that will tell the caller that the person u r calling is offline and cannot receive calls(when data is off) on receivers phone. Even if the data is off on receivers phone the call keeps on ringing and the caller feels calls are ignored. Please fix this. Thank you
175,BARNALI DAS,5,"It is my first review on play store. To me it is the best app, but sometimes it stops horribly and that makes my phone hang very badly I had not updated it for 2 years but now when I updated it, many new features came. I like this app, the most horrible thing is when do video call mainly group calls if the network is high someone's picture will be hasy. Though it is also helpful as to country to country no app works for communication except for whatsapp that's made me happy.."
176,shweet summu,2,The whastapp worked really well until my last update as my screen freeze whenever I type a message or listen to any voice recordings.. I have installed and then unnstalled again evrythting but it's still of no use! The screen freezez every single time when you are typing and it suddenly gets freezed ! Hereby requesting whatsapp to rectify the issue at the earliest.
177,Christo Kruger,5,"How can I even approach this? The Application is the best and in becoming such a massive undertaking to ensure bugs and all fault loggs are thoroughly examined an patched before the next update. No other companies had the foresight or launched any breakthrough technology and improvements to even try and compete with WA even before it was acquired by FB . So I think an automatical rating of best app ever would do,. No other company has the resources to be able to launch anything close."
178,Jayanta kumar,1,From the last update whatsapp is not working . It freezes frequently . I am not able to keep it open for more than 2 min or so . I am a student and I am facing problem in doing my schoolwork due to this problem . Please fix it as soon as possible . Its my humble request . Please
179,or 1324,4,"This is a great communication app but I found one annoying bug: When I connect to whatsapp web when my phone's language is hebrew and try to write the ``` effect, only a litte part of the effect is happening... I see the different font but the characters do not grow... I found this bug when I built an app that convert emojis and text to text from those emojis. I used the ``` sign to minimize the different between each letter on different screens but when I connected to web it looked wierd."
180,Malaika Zafar,5,"Dear Sir/Ma'am, I couldn't able to make calls to few of my friends. If I call them, they couldn't hear my voice and I couldn't hear their voice. But if they call me on some other cell phones both of us can hear eachother. But if I call some other people there is no issue. Kindly please inform me its solution. I'll bee thankful to you."
181,Vinay Suthar,1,"WhatsApp is really messing up with my phone Samsung galaxy A7 2018. Whenever i open whatsapp to see messages, I just can't go back again. Whatsapp just freezes my phone's all three touch buttons-minimize, home and back button. Please fix this. I am dealing with it since so many months and now i am fed up of this."
182,Ahamed Haseef,1,What the hell is going on. Even I cannot read an article . For the very 1st I thought my mobile was hacked and reset my mobile and install the WhatsApp again and than again same issue . I dunno why. Even when I'm open a message also its getting struck and then going to the main page.
183,Mohammed Zahoor,4,"Whatsapp is good,but I wish it could have the features of YoWhatsapp created by an unknown person.It would be better if it had the features like airplane mode,showing the last seen and online on the front screen,separate column for groups,directly messaging a number feature,it would be really a great thing.Unfortunately,the YoWhatsapp is from an untrustworthy source"
184,Shubham Sisodia,4,"Hey! The app is best, there's no doubt. But past few days (10-12 days) my what's app DP is unable to update. Whenever I update DP it automatically removes the photo from DP within few seconds. I had also mailed the problem but there's no action taken. Please fix this problem ASAP. Regards !"
185,Mehar un Nisa,4,This is really ridiculous. With the last update I am not able to receive any notifications of messages and even I am not able to receive any call unless I am online on whatsapp. And sometimes even being online I don't receive any chat notification. I wanted to give 5 stars because this is my favorite app but now I am giving only 2 because these problems are really annoying me. Please fix it.
186,knowledge about everything,4,Good but often stops during video call. I can't connect to my father while calling nd other contacts whenever I call it works good. Nd my storage space is good. Fix this issue and yeah you must add one feature also just like status option is provided to whom of the contacts I want to show my profile. Bring Filter option like snapchat . Good but often stops during video call. I can't connect to my father while calling nd other contacts whenever I call it works good. Nd my storage space is ok
187,SAGAR BHARDWAJ,1,It's not being working properly .As I am making a whatsapp account it does not send any verification code and we see on screen something went wrong please go to google play store and download the latest version of whatsapp I have done it but it doesn't work . That's why I have given only one star

Wait untill you're no longer roaming or connect your phone to Wi-Fi to back up to Google Drive"". In my phone setting, mobile data usage is allowed even while roaming. Please resolve it. Thank you."
189,Mihir Thakur,5,"It's the best messenger app. I love it, as it's lockdown outside it helped me to communicate with my friends through group. But I also want a new feature that you can add the option to give group status. And give status reply in the group. I wish that you will add these options. Thank you 😊"
190,Leela Amma,1,"App is good but there is a problem, because my another WhatsApp number is banned I don't know why! Then I send Gmail to Whatsapp support and they replied to me they say, We have reason to believe your account activity has violated our terms of service and decided to keep your account banned. We received a large number of complaints of your account and any in order to protect our users' privacy, we won't disclose the nature of the complaints. And they say to me. WhatsApp is suck \U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44f"
191,AMAN VERMA,4,"My phone does not have fingerprint scanner. So, I am unable to lock my whatsapp. Installing a third party app is too slow and sometimes don't work. So, give a feature of pattern lock. It will be very usefull. I also want to give five stars. Add a pin or pattern lock. I need that. And then i will surely give five stars."
192,Jojie Arianne,4,I really like this messaging app. I just hope that there is a search button for stickers. I could not use much because I still need to choose manually. Edit: I sometimes see a search button on the stickers but it always disappears after using it.
193,S. Ryo,1,"Overall,a good app. But since the latest update, it has gotten really laggy. Whenever I try to type a message,it says ""whatsapp has stopped working "" and closes the app. And happens every 2 minute!Please fix this as soon as possible..."
194,Shahriar Niloy,2,Although i liked it\u2019s algorithm but still 2 star because it was riping my ears of! The sound of RECONNECTING is not only annoying but it also damages the ear. Literally the operating team needs to be more practical about this. Imagine someone is on a audio call & this terrible sound occurs! It just bursts the ears! Fix it man!!!
195,Fish Leong Sok Yee,3,"Can provide option that download the media in group chat folder? Example, usually all pictures save in default folder name \u300aWhatapp Picture\u300b, users can provide options that let user decide the pictures of group/ individual chat room saving in different folder names. It will reduce the time of users to sorting the media."
196,Lebogang Mokoto,3,"It's honestly an okay app when it feels like it, I truly enjoy the video calls though because they give me no problems unlike calling someone straight, it cuts and pauses a lot then blames it on network. Also it would be amazing if in the next update they just add a feature where you can have different themes for each chat."
197,madival dandainavar,4,"It's great messaging app no questions there, but I really thing whatsapp needs report option whenever a person receives a message from unknown number along with existing block option....by that way we can find spammers or people who try to do online fraud can be caught easily and then whatsapp can do a permanent ban on those numbers"
198,ART NOKIA,2,They are not heard about my voice during whatapp voice or video call. I gave microphone permission to the application and reinstall the application but it could not help. I'm facing this issue for last months. All other video calling and voice calls working fine. I'm facing this issue only in Whatsapp. Please solve this. My device is nokia 8.1\U0001f64f\U0001f64f
199,Kalyani Rao,3,"The app has been causing issues with video calls. If I'm on an audio call and want to switch to video call, the screen goes all black, so I can neither accept incoming video call, nor see anything else on the screen. Can this be fixed please? The issue is happening since the last 3 days."
200,Life with Alaina,5,"Awesome app! Best place to talk to your friend! The only thing that could be improved is the call and video call, its too glitchy. But over all such a good app to use! \U0001f496\U0001f496\U0001f496 you can send videos, locations, photos, links, music and much more!!!
