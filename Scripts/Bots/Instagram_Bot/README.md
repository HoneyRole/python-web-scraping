#### It can perform the followng task:

1. **Give list of people** :
	- Who don't follow you back 
		- _Optional-> Unfollow them all_

It saves your user id and password in the same location as your `.py`/`.exe` as `Users.txt`, and don't worry, your user id might be readable to you but password is in the encrypted form

It also saves boht of the list of the people in the form of simple text file.
