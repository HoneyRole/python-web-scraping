## Deploy

You can easily *deploy this bot* on [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) or on your **local machine**by following the below steps:

> Note: While pasting on your machine terminal you should use `Ctrl+Shift+V` but make sure to use `Ctrl+V` to paste in the Python Anywhere bash console from browser.

Create a free Python Anywhere account and open a Bash Console, which has everything pre-loaded.

If you are planning to deploy on your **own machine**, make sure to have `Python3+`, `pip`, and `make`. 

The following instructions will work smoothly on Linux and Mac. If you are on Windows, you may have to make slight modifications. Google is your best friend here.

- Create a `projects` directory and move into it

      mkdir projects && cd projects

- Clone this repository containing the collection of bots
  
      git clone https://github.com/aahnik/lovely-telegram.git

- Delete all other folders except the folder containing this bot
  
      find ./lovely-telegram -mindepth 1 ! -regex '^./lovely-telegram/runPython_bot\(/.*\)?' -delete

- Now move into the directory which contains this README file, you are reading now.

      cd lovely-telegram/runPython_bot

- Now add the token in the first line of `token.txt`.Run `cat > token.txt` -> Paste the token -> Press `Ctrl+D`

- Now its time to install all dependancies. Simply run `make requirements`

- Activate the bot by running `make start`

- You may now close the console window from your browser, but the bot will still continue running.

Your bot is now up and running, Enjoy ! ðŸ˜Š

To stop the bot, Press `Ctrl+C`. To restart the bot run `make start`

## Limitations

Currently the bot is deployed on a Free Tier account of Python Anywhere.

For security and performance reasons,you **cannot** do the following with the bot:

- import any package
- run the `input()` function
- run the `open()` function
- Execute a piece of code which takes longer than 30s to execute.

You may overcome these limitations by tweaking the code a little bit and running the bot on your own server.
