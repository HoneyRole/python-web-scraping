00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,040
hello friends so we are back today continuing
from the last class where we studied what

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,270
is cognitive psychology and what is the subject
matter of cognitive psychology so in that

3
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,750
class earlier class we saw the basic ah subject
matter of cognitive psychology what are the

4
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,780
various inputs from various schools of psychology
to cognitive psychology what is it that we

5
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,610
study in cognitive psychology and the various
paradigms which are there for the study of

6
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,269
cognitive psychology how they explain mental
events and mental facts

7
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,049
in the last class we discussion cognition
is about understanding mental events and mental

8
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:16,150
facts ah how does mental processing take place
or mental events and how does the mind come

9
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:22,600
into play and what role the blame has in the
mind

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,960
in todays lecture we look at the various ways
of studying cognition what are the various

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,909
methods which are available for studying cognition
so let us begin

12
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,800
there from the start of cognitive psychology
and the or the of cognitive psychology there

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:49,570
were several methods which was out there to
study cognitive psychology the basic ah method

14
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:59,820
that primitive cognitive psychology or artificial
intelligence used didnt employ any role of

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:07,450
brain into it so the earlier the first advent
of cognitive psychology or the first ah wave

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:13,550
of cognitive psychology basically banked on
information processing theory

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,580
and so information processing theory was all
about mental processing how mental events

18
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,760
pro gets process to save ah several ah mental
mechanisms and what is the input what is the

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,250
output that kind of ah ah process or that
kind of structure was which have been studied

20
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,360
by cognitive psychology so information processing
theory as we saw in the last class actually

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,270
ah looks at the events and the mechanism frosting
mechanisms through which mental events or

22
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,510
mental ah activity is generated

23
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:58,840
in contrast artificial intelligence was ah
also looking at how at the process level mental

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,780
events are ah studied and both of these methods
did not play or did not emphasize the brain

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:16,300
in any ways as we know today that ah the mind
is actually ah a software or kind of a software

26
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,740
or mind is actually a a fact which is made
by the brain and so studying of the brain

27
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,800
is very important in studying ah cognitive
psychology

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,650
now some of the ah main reasons why the brain
should be included in the study of cognitive

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,920
ah psychology is to understand the dissociation
and association the process of dissociation

30
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,989
and associations because these dissociation
and associations will tell us what processes

31
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,599
are similar if two mental acts takes place
and what processes are different if in two

32
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,150
mental events or two mental process ah acts

33
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:06,340
to the heart of this debate is the idea of
localizing those brain areas to finding out

34
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:15,460
those brain areas which act up which show
activity when a particular cognitive act ah

35
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,840
a particular cognitive process is initiated
and so what the new da ah cognitive psychology

36
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,250
or the new field of cognitive psychology is
looking at not only the information processing

37
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:34,250
or the artificial intelligence approach where
mental process events and ah various other

38
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:42,240
ah mental events are studied but in relation
to it the new wave of cognitive psychology

39
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,129
is also looking at brain areas of how brain
areas or what brain areas are really ah involved

40
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,460
in producing cognition

41
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,069
there are multiple methods of studying cognitive
psychology as i said and so each of these

42
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:07,219
methods use a different measure a different
way to study cognition now these methods all

43
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:13,139
have their own problems and all have their
own limitations and what has to have what

44
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:21,289
to study to you to find out the complete method
or ah a perfect method to study cognition

45
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:29,219
would take into account the all these methods
why should we do that we should do that as

46
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:35,369
multiple methods when they provide information
what would happen is that the limitation of

47
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:40,150
one method could become the benefit of other
method and the benefit of what method could

48
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,770
serve as or could add up to more affording
information

49
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:52,919
and so when looking at multiple methods one
looking at multiple ways multiple ah ideas

50
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,430
or multiple approaches to studying cognition
this will give us a more complete picture

51
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:05,860
or a more desirable outcome of what cognition
is all about now the general goal of cognitive

52
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:14,469
psychology is to study dissociations and associations
at the level of the brain now when i say dissociation

53
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,400
and association what is it that i actually
mean

54
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:31,580
dissociation is a fact or a term which explains
that one if two processes or if two mental

55
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:41,830
acts give rise to activation in one area of
the brain how to we dissociate it simply stating

56
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:49,439
what it would really mean that an event if
an event or a variable leads to brain activation

57
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,870
during the processing of one task but doesnt
lead to the brain activation on the other

58
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,149
task this is what dissociation is

59
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:03,529
this will tell us which task requires that
particular mental activity or that particular

60
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:09,379
mental process and which of the task doesnt
require that particular mental task lets understand

61
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:16,430
with an example allen bradley developed the
idea of working membrane and so what bradly

62
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:25,139
said is that there is a whole conceptualization
of the central executive ah component of memory

63
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:33,280
which ha ah executes most of the ah working
process in in working memory and within the

64
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,009
central executive or with the central executive
or other parts of ah the working memory which

65
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:48,689
is ah the spatial store and the phonological
loop the idea of working memory is conceptualized

66
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:58,849
in this way that input or the encoding ah
from the environment is thrown into the central

67
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:05,199
executive which then assigns the audio input
the auditory input into the phonological loop

68
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,969
and the visual input into the spatial ah ah
and spatial loop or the spatial store what

69
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,159
does it mean

70
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:20,909
it means that at the level of processing itself
at the level of encoding itself or just after

71
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:31,800
encoding the mind takes away two inputs from
two difference senses and processes them separately

72
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,460
now the same region of the brain is involved
in storing the phonological ah ah ah loop

73
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,899
or the phonological matter and the spatial
matter is that true

74
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:54,890
so experiments are done to find out whether
this as the assigning of the visual ah input

75
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:02,140
and the auditory input into different stores
or the working memory whether they use the

76
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,010
same mental ah ah mental process or the same
brain areas and if different brain areas were

77
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:16,700
activated then we could say that both the
task the tasks of assigning the the auditory

78
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,910
input into the phonological loop and the visual
input into the spatial sketch pad they require

79
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,190
different brain areas and through this we
can then specifically study one of these areas

80
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,060
or deficit one of these areas

81
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:38,150
so allen bradley what he did was he did some
studies to find out what really happens at

82
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:48,960
the level of the brain so he specifically
inhabited or the visual input and he saw that

83
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,680
there was no ah ah deficit into the auditory
input what he did was he gave a visual task

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:06,710
to his subject and with this visual task he
actually loaded the working memory or ah the

85
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:15,270
attention the attention span with more ah
data more items and when that happen the subject

86
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:22,470
was not able the subject could not process
the vision input but the auditory input was

87
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,610
intact plus understand this in the more easy
example

88
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,110
so what allen bradley wanted to study is rather
if the visual input is loaded whether the

89
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,070
auditory input can function on its own meaning
which both the processes are both the processes

90
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,190
of visual input and the auditory input in
the working memory are ah have dissociative

91
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,130
processes or dissociative brain regions involved
into it

92
00:10:51,130 --> 00:11:01,770
so in his task he gave ah visual task and
loaded the attention or loaded ah the central

93
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,580
executive with more visual information so
the subjects are not able to rehearse or not

94
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:15,750
able to ah study back the visual inputs but
the auditory input the auditory information

95
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,530
which was stored in phonological loop got
a proper rehearsal and so when the test was

96
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:25,400
done it was found out that although the subjects
are not able to correctly identify visual

97
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:34,120
ah items or visual matter auditory inputs
or auditory ah test or auditory inform information

98
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,740
retrieval was not at all disturbed

99
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,350
this particular ex experiment shows that dissociation
is at the core of studying cognition why because

100
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:55,110
dissociation can tell but tell us which processes
have similar although they have similar representations

101
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,910
but they use different mechanisms

102
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,120
similar to it is the study of associations
in associations what we actually study is

103
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:14,040
whether two different processes ah are linked
or two different processes actually excite

104
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,200
the same brain region for example in this
case ah experiments were done to find out

105
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,350
whether the frontal cortex the frontal regions
and ah another area of brain whether both

106
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:36,390
of them have anything to do with spatial representations
or ah ah of encoding of special ah into spatial

107
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,840
encodings

108
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:45,560
what they found out is that spatial information
when encoded through two different processes

109
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,720
or two different brain regions gave rise to
similar representations meaning which both

110
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,990
the brain processes or both the brain areas
although different but they combindly give

111
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,760
rise give rise to same interpretations

112
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,540
now why is the study of dissociation and association
important the study of dissociation and association

113
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:15,010
is important to find out which processes although
ah ah emanate from the same structure but

114
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:22,250
they lead to different task and which if two
different processes which emanate from different

115
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,650
brain areas converge on to a particular task
to find out the specificity to find out the

116
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,770
ah process through this

117
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,830
now the methods of studying cognition so there
are four different methods through which cognition

118
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:44,210
can be studied and so these methods are the
behavioral methods the correlation neural

119
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:51,100
method the causal method and the modeling
within the modeling we have the box model

120
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,680
approach and the neural network model of approach

121
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,720
so let us start with the behavioral methods
what the behavioral methods generally do is

122
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,310
they look at directly observable behavior
like reaction time the time when pa person

123
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:14,650
takes to react to something or accuracy of
how accurate a retrieval is from encoding

124
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:22,920
so these processes or these events responses
are map on to behavioral methods

125
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:32,070
the accuracy of response or the time taken
to response gives us an idea on to what behavioral

126
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,800
processes are going through in the processing
of a particular mental event now researchers

127
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,320
they attempt to draw inferences about what
kind of interpretations and what kind of processing

128
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,110
leads to the differences in accuracy and differences
in reaction time

129
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,850
four popular approaches that have been or
four popular methods within the behavioral

130
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,160
method has been used so what we will look
at is what is the beni what are the benefits

131
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,120
of each methods what are the drawbacks and
that kind of thing into less so lets go into

132
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,640
that comparison

133
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,600
as you can see the major behavioral methods
and methods used in cognitive psychology the

134
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,840
major methods are looking at the accuracy
of how accurate the retrieval is from the

135
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:26,420
encoding percentage of that is percentage
of correct responses response times judgments

136
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
and protocol

137
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:35,410
now lets take these methods one by one the
method of accuracy in this method of accuracy

138
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,900
a very good example to look at is item recall
or memory recall for item such as remembering

139
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:50,550
a particular job requirements or or a particular
task the advantage is this it gives an objective

140
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:58,420
idea of the processing effectiveness how effective
is the mental mechanism or the mental process

141
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,740
which is processing that particular event
the limit to accuracy method or behavioral

142
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,750
methods of accuracy is something called the
ceiling effect and floor effect

143
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,190
ceiling effect is when a task is made too
easy so that each person gets the highest

144
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,660
score and so it will be very difficult to
find out the exact processing mechanism similar

145
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,740
to this is the floor effect in which a task
is made so difficult that none of the pe people

146
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:37,100
are able to solve it and due to this will
not be able to a certain what processing mechanisms

147
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,560
are at play also they suffer from something
called speed accuracy trade of which means

148
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,040
that as it want to be more accurate on something
the more time it will it is going to take

149
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,490
as accuracy increases more accurate we want
the speed decreases or the time to perform

150
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,250
a task decreases is a inverse relationship
the second method here is response time which

151
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,410
is the time one takes to come up with a particular
response the advantage is this that it is

152
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:14,809
an objective method and suitable for measuring
of processing mechanisms that is at play and

153
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:22,339
also those unconscious processing mechanisms
now this the limitation to this method is

154
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:28,700
something called experimental expectancy effect
and task demands

155
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,950
what this really means is that each experimenter
when he is gets into an experiment he has

156
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:43,179
certain expectancy he has a certain want from
the subjects so this gets transferred to the

157
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:50,179
subjects subject identifies these expectancy
and actually behaves in a similar way so if

158
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,520
experiment of ones are subject to say yes
to most of the things or take more time in

159
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,470
responding what would really happen if the
subject understands that or judges that from

160
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,649
the from the experimenter and even if the
processing is fast they take more time

161
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:11,360
the third method is called the judgment method
here what really happens is to find out what

162
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,529
really ah what really is happening in or how
does particular process really work is people

163
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:21,990
are given a judgment scale and so there are
sev these are seven point or eight point nine

164
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:30,470
point scales which are given to people who
actually judge or go ahead and rate how they

165
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,539
are processing a particular item it is very
inexpensive to ah collect and it excesses

166
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:41,059
subjects reaction to a particular cognitive
process for example the thing like how are

167
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:46,139
you feeling right now and so test can be given
to people and what they could do is actually

168
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:51,990
go ahead and on a seven point scale go ahead
and tell on several questions or provide responses

169
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,019
to several questions as to how they are feeling

170
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,370
the problem with this method is that subjects
are not aware of how to use this scale and

171
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,720
so we get into difficulty the last of the
behavioral methods which i use to study cognition

172
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,779
is something called the protocol collection
the method here allows subject to verbally

173
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:20,480
announce what is going on or what they are
doing for example if i ask someone to go ahead

174
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,249
and show me how counting of two and three
is done

175
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:28,610
this person has to actually start the pa the
experiment the subject has to actually go

176
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:36,520
ahead and relate how his go how he is doing
the addition process for example thinking

177
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,960
of the number two thinking of the rule for
addition thinking of the number three going

178
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,179
adding carrying off and so on the protocol
method really ah uses or really requires the

179
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:54,240
subject to announce what is going on mentally
this method can tell you or the advantage

180
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,879
of this method is basically it can tell you
what are the steps basic steps through which

181
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:04,950
a mental processing happens or any task what
is the mental requirement for this task what

182
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,999
is the mental process for this task

183
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:12,120
for complex cognitive processes this cannot
obviously be used because people would not

184
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,509
be aware of what is going on and they could
not or they could not ac accurately go ahead

185
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,309
and describe what is being going on

186
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:28,440
the next method that we use in studying cognition
a cognitive processes is the correlation or

187
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,100
the neural methods now what does correlation
really mean or what is this what is the heart

188
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:42,070
of this method the heart of this method is
localization as we discussed at the start

189
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,960
of the lecture that the new way of a cognitive
science is looking up at the brain towards

190
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:58,149
the brain to explain how this cognitive processes
or mental events are being processed or how

191
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:04,350
is the mental event actually being processed
what is going on inside the mind what is going

192
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:12,309
on inside the subjects cognition how is the
processing input and output coming into effect

193
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:18,480
now there i explain to you that the brain
is a recent edition why because the brain

194
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:27,649
can objectively tell you the processing the
methods or by through which ah particular

195
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:35,159
mental event is being processed and so this
method looks at finding out or localizing

196
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,940
that area of the brain when a particular mental
event is being ah carried out what this method

197
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,039
does is actually tries to form a correlation
between the fact that when a mental event

198
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:53,309
happens which areas of the brain actually
show activity and so through correlation it

199
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:59,499
tries to show off or tries to ah find out
which area of the brain resp is responsible

200
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:04,970
through which kind of mental activity this
will benefit us as we will be able to specifically

201
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:11,749
now tell that ah each mental process or each
mental event or each mental mechanism is relate

202
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,640
to a particular brain area

203
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:22,379
the problem here could be that sometimes numerous
other brain areas beside the area of interest

204
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:29,749
also get excited and so it is it is a little
bit difficult or i would say a little challenging

205
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:36,379
to pinpoint the area that is responsible for
the core mental process which is being carried

206
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,379
out

207
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:45,280
another problem with this method is correlation
does not lead to causation correlation simply

208
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,809
means the two events by chance are related
to each other they do not mean that process

209
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:58,110
a leads to process b and so we cannot with
confidence say that this brain area excitation

210
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,070
of a particular brain area leads to a particular
mental event or particular mental process

211
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,739
or particular cognitive event

212
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:09,759
now there are couple of techniques which are
here so let us look at those techniques let

213
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,200
us look at the advantages of this techniques
and the disadvantages of the technique and

214
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,890
discuss how this method really works so the
causal neural methods have four different

215
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,970
techniques to look at i am sorry three different
techniques to look at and these ma techniques

216
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,942
are the neuro physiological studies the transcranial
magnetic stimulation and the drugs so i was

217
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:39,649
saying as i was seeing the correlation neural
methods the problems with the correlation

218
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:47,660
neural method so there are two problems with
this first that many areas side along or they

219
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,769
get along or an activated in addition to the
main area of interest and so what really happens

220
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,650
the problem with this method is to localize
the area of interest because the ma areas

221
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,519
also which inside along gets activated

222
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,899
and the second problem with the correlation
neural methods is that correlation not causing

223
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:16,609
causation now what really happens in correlation
is two events a and b they although show in

224
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:23,450
sink activity but correlation does not guarantee
that a is the cause of b or b is caused by

225
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:31,049
a and so there is no way to find out what
process leads to or what method leads to what

226
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:38,399
structural activation in terms of the brain
mind ah relations it would be very difficult

227
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,249
to find out whether the activation in area
deep to the mental processing or where the

228
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:47,220
mental processing leads to the activation
in an area

229
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:56,249
so there are four different methods here techniques
here to study the correlation or the correlational

230
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:04,210
localization of brain areas the first of these
technique is the e e g or the electroencephalograph

231
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,369
the electroencephalograph can also be used
for recording something called the e r b s

232
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:15,960
now what the e e g or the electroencephalograph
records are potentials from the scalp when

233
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,980
a particular mental activity takes place it
believed that a mental when a particular mental

234
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:28,549
activity takes place there are changes in
neuronal polarity and due to this a weak electrical

235
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,730
current actually passes to the scalp surface

236
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:39,999
the e e g senses which are placed in the scalp
at record these activities and based on that

237
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:47,769
are able to predict whether there is a activity
change from the baseline activity a baseline

238
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:55,340
activity is an activity when no mental processing
is being taking place and and ah when whenever

239
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,600
an activity takes place there will be a change
and so the changed activity subtracted from

240
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,739
the baseline activity will give you the kind
of mental activity if just being taken place

241
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:13,749
e e g s are also used for recording event
related potentials which are basically the

242
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:19,159
potentials which are recorded when a particular
stimulus is set and so after a particular

243
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:27,830
stimulus is initiated from there on to when
the response of the system or when the response

244
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,830
of a person takes place the e e g the ah the
electroencephalographic patterns of the brain

245
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:42,429
recorded and the time codes of this e e g
the time ah the changes in e e g from the

246
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:48,940
stimulus onset to the response is calculated
or recorded or studied and this gives us an

247
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:55,279
idea of what processes and what areas or what
kind of pattern of activity is being ah shown

248
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,279
by the brain

249
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:01,460
generally there are some very fixed patterns
ah that the brain show there is something

250
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:08,279
called the base activity that mostly happens
in everyday life is the alpha activity which

251
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:15,830
falls in the eight to thirteen hertz ah thirteen
cycle per second ah region then if as a person

252
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:21,639
gets more relaxed e the amplitude of these
waves increases and the frequency lowers down

253
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:28,539
when it comes back to something called delta
so on and so forth so as you get more worked

254
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:34,480
up as you are doing more general activity
the amplitude is less the frequency is more

255
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,200
and the banned pattern or the activity pattern
of the brain is generally in the eight to

256
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,659
fourteen hertz cycle per or cycle per second
region

257
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:51,190
an example of using e e g is to find out brain
patterns during sleep or something like ah

258
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,419
ah in terms or e r p something like p three
hundred now p three hundred is actually a

259
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,470
component which happens p three hundred is
when i say component what does it really mean

260
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:11,509
a component is a deviation in an electrical
activity which takes place wa after the start

261
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:17,960
of a event so when a stimulus is given ah
when a stimulus is initiated and the e e g

262
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,999
s are recorded three hundred milliseconds
after the stimulus ah stimulus initiated on

263
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:28,509
the positive direction if a peak is recorded
this is called the p three hundred

264
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:33,729
now the p three hundred generally the component
p three hundred generally is associated with

265
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:41,520
novelty so when the brain the the process
the mind looks at something which is noble

266
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,729
which is new it generates the p three hundred
activity and so these this this can be recorded

267
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:55,229
the spatial resolution of a e e g is very
poor because it cannot locate the area from

268
00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:01,009
where or the neuronal group from where this
activity is being recorded as current passes

269
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,409
or current moves from the base of the brain
towards the surface of the brain it forms

270
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:11,830
a conical structure and so it loses most of
its strength and it is very ah difficult to

271
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:18,129
to go back in or to reverse engineer from
where the source of this activity is

272
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:23,619
although newer techniques do allow for something
called source localization from actually from

273
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,799
an e e g will pin point ah gross area of where
it is coming from

274
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,029
but generally speaking the e e g s have very
poor resolution in terms of temporal resolution

275
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:41,109
an e e g is excellent because it can show
you within within milliseconds of the activity

276
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:45,580
will within milliseconds of the mental event
the mental activity and can show a correlation

277
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,590
to that so in terms of time of processing
in terms of time course of processing of mental

278
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,750
events the e e g is very good can tell you
what events in in that on the time axis what

279
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,659
events process its a process or what even
processes take place that that kind of information

280
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,039
can be there gathered from an e e g

281
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,669
the invasiveness of this particular method
of the e e g is very low as you know have

282
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:15,669
to put anything inside the body the surface
senses actually captures the information and

283
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:20,739
so not much of an invasive process and the
cost for this particular method is very low

284
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:28,450
its smaller units are available in ah in ah
very few dollars you can buy them and start

285
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,649
using them

286
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:35,679
similar to the e e g is the m e g the magneto
encephalogram where electrical activity instead

287
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,120
of capturing the electrical activity the magnitive
activity is captured an example is detecting

288
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,749
activity from the auditory cortex ah different
picture stones

289
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:53,889
so here there are several sensors which are
put around ah the brain the magnetic activity

290
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:59,350
that is generated when a particular event
happens a particular stimulus ah after the

291
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,269
particular sti stimulus the particular event
which happens are ah recorded or the magnitive

292
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,299
activity of of which is generated by the neuronal
group which is processing the event are captured

293
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,299
through it

294
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:16,669
the special resolution of the magneto encephalograph
is very good it is up under one centimeter

295
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:22,570
in terms of temporal relation also it is very
good this is excellent the invasiveness since

296
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,200
we are not putting anything inside the body
it is very low and so invasiveness wise m

297
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,759
e g s are very good but the problem is buying
an m e g or establishing an m e g requires

298
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,590
a very high cost so cost too high it requires
ah ah system which produces this magnetic

299
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,330
moments or this prod produces magnetic fields
which actually are able to process or which

300
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:50,489
actually are able to record changes in brain
activity or neuronal activity when a particular

301
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:51,919
mental event is going on

302
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,009
third method that we use as a correlation
method or for localizing brain areas that

303
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:02,559
are responsible for a particular mental event
is the positron emission tomography the p

304
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:10,519
e t in cognitive psychology we ge we generally
use the fifteen o isotope the fifteen oxygen

305
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,659
isotope as a method for doing p e t so what
really happens is that the oxygen the fifteen

306
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:23,679
ah the o fifteen isotope which is radioactive
is injected with normal ah within the normal

307
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,679
body

308
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,359
and so this particular isotope is ah moving
around the body so when the brain does it

309
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:34,210
is believed that the when when the brain does
a particular function it pulls up more and

310
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:40,960
more ah blood and with the blood more and
more water also transports to the brain and

311
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,470
so when a particular at ah region of the brain
shows more fifteen the accumulation of more

312
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:52,789
fifteen isotope that is the region which is
ah correlated or which is assume to be active

313
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:59,309
in a particular process and this is how the
p e t or fifteen oxygen isotope is done

314
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,220
generally it is used to study or mostly it
is used to study language areas of the brain

315
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,720
of how the language areas process or what
is the processing that happens in language

316
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,390
area when we actually speak the special resolution
is very good up to one centimeter but the

317
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,859
temporal resolution is very poor because it
takes almost forty seconds to generate an

318
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:28,379
image out of ah the p e t of fifteen oxygen
ah isotope or the o fifteen isotope

319
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:36,529
invasiveness is high as we in ah as we inject
an isotope of oxygen which is radioactive

320
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:42,729
into the blood and so this has radioactive
properties which could ah lead to problems

321
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:49,929
although ah the kind of radioactivity that
happens with an oxy with o fifteen isotope

322
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:57,809
is as less as ah what a airline pilot would
actually get through in half a year of his

323
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:04,889
work so it is it is very ah very less but
still it is radioactive and so its best to

324
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:05,979
avoid it

325
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:11,360
on terms of the purchase cost it is a high
purchase cost because p e t need cyclotron

326
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:18,561
and p e t cameras and things for ah ah noticing
those senses which can go ahead and record

327
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:24,080
the radioactivity the low radioactivity of
this oxygen isotope so it is very costly in

328
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:32,010
that method and improvement on the p e t is
the m r i and the f m r i which was ah which

329
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,389
is a new addition to the study of the brain
or the brain processes or cognitive processes

330
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:42,880
the m r i on on one hand is actually stores
the structural integrity of how the structure

331
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,380
of the brain is the f m r i on the other hand
shows the blocks blood oxygen level depending

332
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:55,639
or how much oxygenated blood is taken up by
the brain when a particular activity is ah

333
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,190
being ah being processed by the brain

334
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:10,230
the m r i works on the principle of body magnets
or ah atoms of the ah of the body and how

335
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,290
they aligned to an external magnetic field
so what the m r i generally does it produces

336
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:21,750
a uniform magnetic field to which most atoms
of the body aligned and then radio ah ah pulse

337
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:28,980
is created or radio puls is it is generated
which disturbs the alignment of most atoms

338
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:38,590
of the ah of the area which is in the m r
i scan the speed of returning back is calculated

339
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,320
when when the magnets disaligned when the
particular pose

340
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,000
or the ah the particular elements in the in
the particular atoms of elements in the body

341
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,010
when radioisotope disaligns them from the
aligned ah from the ah alignment that the

342
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,820
m r i magnet does it returns back and the
speed with which the return back is calculated

343
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,420
and from there an image is generated and these
images or the speed at which the different

344
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:16,310
atoms get back or ah they come back is different
different media like bone ah skin or ah that

345
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,900
other issues in in in the body they have different
speeds of returning back or this is calculated

346
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,460
and an image is generated

347
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:32,410
in an f m r i what we really do is ah the
amount of ah oxygenated blood in comparison

348
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,680
to the deoxygenated blood at a particular
brain region which is processing a particular

349
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,420
event ah is taking that is calculated and
that gives us an idea of which region of the

350
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,930
brain is showing an activity through a sensor

351
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,320
the spatial resolution of an both the m r
i and f m r i is very superb it is very good

352
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,030
in the terms of millimeter inch the temporal
resolution is not that good but depends upon

353
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:06,870
ah the level of resolution that you want or
ah generally it is in terms of several seconds

354
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,760
so not like the e e g which can give you ah
the millisecond kind of a temporal resolution

355
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,580
but not as low as ah the p e t which gives
which takes almost forty seconds to produce

356
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
an image

357
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,360
so m r i s have decent time requirement or
this takes decent time to produce images the

358
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,450
invasiveness is low because m r i does not
ah the m r i and f m r i does not inject anything

359
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,060
into the body so the invasiveness is low but
here the purchase causes very high because

360
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,100
the kind of magnets that the m r i and f m
r i uses are huge electromagnets and they

361
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,840
have huge ah amount of cost involved into
them

362
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,570
the last method that we use here is called
the optical imaging method and here this is

363
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:55,060
a recent addition so it has been found out
that the brain is transparent to certain kind

364
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:03,600
of ah light waves and when these light waves
are shown into the brain through a through

365
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:11,080
a laser the speed with which they return back
can give you an idea of how much blood is

366
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,860
flowing through that particular area and so
this can be used this method is now being

367
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,670
used to find out the amount of blood travelling
through a particular area depending on how

368
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:29,350
much ah light laser light is being reflected
back through ah various tissues and and various

369
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,830
substances in in the brain

370
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:38,010
it is the special resolution at present is
very poor and the ah temporal resolution it

371
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:43,450
depends on the level of resolution and several
minutes takes up from forming an image the

372
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:51,170
invasiveness is generally ah medium to low
as lasers are ah shown on to or lo lasers

373
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:55,680
are focused on to your brain so it has some
level of an invasiveness but not too high

374
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,320
the cost of purchase is very low but the temporal
relation is not appropriate

375
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,020
one of the examples of f m r i which is ah
ah functional ah optical imaging ah suit which

376
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:14,480
is available these days another method of
studying cognition is through using the causal

377
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,300
neural method of studying cognition what does
this method do in this method it is assumed

378
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,090
that if certain regions of the brain are required
for certain activity what would happen if

379
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:32,770
that vision of the brain is somehow not allowed
to do any activity or stops from doing activity

380
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:41,300
and so one of the ah one of the particular
ah methods within this approach is using patience

381
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,660
who have certain brain damage

382
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:52,300
so suppose the broca area is responsible for
speech and so if somebody has a deficit in

383
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,620
the broca area and if certain type of speech
related experiments are given to ah to them

384
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:04,090
and compared to a particular normal ah ah
person it would be easy to understand what

385
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:09,830
kind of what kind of activity does the brain
does what is requirement of this area and

386
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:16,360
so on and so forth so here in this in the
neurophysiological studies patients with localized

387
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,090
brain damage or brain damage to certain areas
are used and they compared with people who

388
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:26,741
have no brain damage and this is how the cognitive
processes or the mental processes that go

389
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:31,560
on when a particular mental activity is being
done is actually studied

390
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,890
example could be deficit in understanding
the how nouns and verbs are processed and

391
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:43,360
so people who have deficit in this area if
you give them a noun and a verb the area since

392
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,100
it is deficit so now it will show no activity
whereas people who do not have deficits will

393
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,240
show different activity and so that will be
enough to say that this area is responsible

394
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,960
for a particular kind of act that is being
required the advantages is of this method

395
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,730
is testing theories of causal role of specific
brain areas testing theories of shad in distinct

396
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,670
processing and used in different task relatively
easy and inexpensive to collect

397
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,950
the limitation is we do not find too many
people who have damaged areas and so the idea

398
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:24,760
is its its very difficult to ah find people
with damage areas also when damage to a particular

399
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,370
area is there there will be ah related areas
which might be affected by the damage so it

400
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,460
is very difficult to localize whether the
this damage is to this area or which this

401
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,610
is damage the damaged brain area also has
any relation with other areas

402
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,000
the second method in this particular group
is called the transcranial magnetic stimulation

403
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,400
now in t m s there are two types of t m s
s one is called the single pulse and the other

404
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,900
is called the repeated t m s or the repeated
trans ah pulse may trans transcranial magnetic

405
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:10,310
stimulation what really happens here it ha
is that a huge coil is put into a near or

406
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,550
on the surface of an area to temporarily inhabit
and a large current is passed through this

407
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,550
coil

408
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:22,290
the magnetic field that is generated by this
coil temporarily inhabits a particular area

409
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:28,750
and through through that we can find out whether
the disrupt how what will happen if a particular

410
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,480
area which is known to be associated with
a particular ah activity cognitive activity

411
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,720
if it is disrupted what really happens so
what we could or ah studies of how visual

412
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,510
imagery is different from perception can be
done by using t m s t m s or using a r t m

413
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,780
s and blocking the occipital lobe

414
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,240
now there is a difference between single pulse
t m s and r t m s in single pulse t m s a

415
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:04,830
single pulse is given after the stimulus is
is is generated and the time course of this

416
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:11,120
pulse is recorded and that gives us an idea
of how the or what activity is happening in

417
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
that area

418
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,860
whereas in r t m s repeated pulses are given
over a particular area so that these weak

419
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:25,380
pulses they add up together to inhabit a particular
area the inhabition happens because the neurons

420
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:34,350
under that area becomes too fa too ah too
extended they they fired so many times that

421
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:40,460
they they ah go through a phase of non firing
and that inhabits the area or that that depolarization

422
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:44,290
inhabits that area activity in that area

423
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,820
so advantages it is it has the same advantage
as the neurophysiological studies but here

424
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,950
the lesions are restricted and also the idea
here is that in these regions in in in the

425
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,330
t m s the disruption is for a very beu brief
period of time and so patients can come out

426
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,200
out of it or subjects can come out of it

427
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,680
also t m s s can be done for surface areas
it cannot be done for deep areas of the brain

428
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,530
ah and so it is one of the disadvantage on
limitation of this particular method another

429
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:22,090
method which can relate or which can show
how a particular brain area disrupting or

430
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,110
particular brain area has effects on the particular
mental process is using specific drugs so

431
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:32,910
here what happens is first a pa particular
drug is specifically used and these drugs

432
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:38,110
inhabit a particular area of interest and
so once this area of interest is inhabited

433
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:43,980
the same task is given to a person who has
taken this drug which inhabits area and a

434
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,480
person who has not had drugs which inhabits
this area and comparisons are made

435
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,870
these comparisons give us an idea of what
really happens or how mental processes what

436
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:57,500
brain areas are involved what mental processes
is being processed and what is the time course

437
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,310
of process of this ah mental events

438
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:08,220
the problem ah example was disruption of disruptive
action of not adrenal in which is crucial

439
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,110
for the operation of hippocampus non adrenal
injection is given to the hippocampus and

440
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,570
though hippocampus actually becomes temporally
disturbed and so when you give a memory task

441
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:22,040
to this person he will not be able to process
this memory task and not come up with ah ah

442
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:29,690
the better of how ah or the particularly travel
paradigm in comparison to somebody who has

443
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:36,520
no disruptions and this will show how much
or to what extent does which part of hippocampus

444
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,400
relates to a particular memory type

445
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,520
drugs when used to inhabit a particular area
effects not only the area of interest but

446
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,950
also effects other area which is related to
this area and so this effect can also be ah

447
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:58,380
ah can can can can be generalized to other
areas similar similar to this effect the t

448
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,261
m s also has this particular disadvantage
where activation of a particular area can

449
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:09,820
lead to activation of subsequent areas and
so what would happen is the disruption will

450
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:15,030
not be in that particular area but also move
out or generalize to other areas of brain

451
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,740
and so to stay with confidence that this is
this disruption of this area is responsible

452
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,810
for particular mental act is becomes a little
bit dicey

453
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:32,330
also the limitation is that many drugs can
create many other ah problem and so this is

454
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:39,870
this has to be used under supervision the
last method that we discussed here of studying

455
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,680
cognition or cognitive psychology is using
modeling

456
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:49,460
so in psychology models are implemented as
computer programs which are meant to be make

457
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,140
the underlying mental representation and processes
that produces different specific types of

458
00:46:54,140 --> 00:47:03,070
human performances so generally models are
made and this models try and explain the different

459
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:11,450
processes events that actually happen when
a particular ah mental event or a particular

460
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:17,390
ah cognition happens there are two types of
models which are studied in cognitive psychology

461
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:23,940
one of these is the process model and the
second is the neural network model so what

462
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,030
is the process model

463
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:31,110
the process model specifies the sequence of
processes that converts an input into output

464
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:37,170
and can these kind of processes can be used
to generate flow charts so basically its it

465
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:43,020
is a box diagram kind of a thing where you
get from one pa one phase to another one event

466
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:49,120
to another event and the processes which relate
these events together

467
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,180
coming back to understanding the process model
let us recall the structure process trade

468
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,460
off that we saw in the last class and so in
the last class and so in the last class steinbergs

469
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:08,240
example in which what he did was he he wanted
to study the mental process of how comparisons

470
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,880
are made in in the ah comparisons are made
in cognition and so what he did was he gave

471
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:26,840
his subjects a particular number of items
to remember and then these items were tested

472
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,880
the retrieval of this the memory for this
item were tested through a probe and what

473
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:40,840
steinberg proposed is that this search for
the target in the list of item that is being

474
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,700
studied or the that is being remembered happens
through a serial process

475
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:55,380
generally speaking this idea that a serial
process look through a list of items which

476
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,460
administrate in memory can be explained through
a process model and this is the process model

477
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,650
which explains how this serial processing
takes place

478
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:09,250
so generally how this experiment would work
is when a probe is given the probe is first

479
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:18,150
encoded prior to this people are given a list
to remember and the list has several numbers

480
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:26,771
or several letters into it and what the job
is the subjects look at a probe and then found

481
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:31,140
out whether this probe is present in this
list or not and to explain this process a

482
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,570
process model can be developed how will the
process model really works look at this in

483
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:42,360
finding out or scanning whether the probe
is present in the list which is remembered

484
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:49,510
the first step is encoding of the probe this
is followed by scanning and comparing where

485
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:56,090
processes internal processes take the probe
and match it with each item which is represented

486
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:03,270
which is stored into the the memory for each
item after a comparison a decision has to

487
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,270
be made

488
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,540
so let us say this if we have one two three
four and five stored list of items stored

489
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,950
or five numbers stored in a memory and if
you want to compare whether three is present

490
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,990
or not how this model will really work or
how this process with really work in terms

491
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:26,730
of mental effect is that three is first encoded
later on three is matched scanned and compared

492
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:32,080
with the fist item this which is one and so
a decision has to be made here whether one

493
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,680
is three or not since both the representations
for three and one are different ah response

494
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,240
has to be executed here the response is no
and the process moves to the second item

495
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,030
now three is take it in compared with two
since both the representations are different

496
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:53,030
ah response here has to be generated which
says the three is not equal to two and so

497
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:57,680
we do not find a match and we move to the
third item which is three now here three and

498
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,910
three had the same representations and so
we get a yes response make a decision the

499
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:10,000
yes response comes in and so in terms of serial
processing the process does not stop here

500
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,790
it continues continues to the end of the list
and then gives the final answer so that is

501
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,990
how the process model explains the process
model ex actually goes ahead and explains

502
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:24,780
how this simple job or simple task of comparing
a probe with the list which has been already

503
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,250
remembered actually goes ahead

504
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:33,280
the problem with this process model is it
tells you about the processes that goes through

505
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,920
or the processes that happen when this list
comparison or probe list testing is done but

506
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,380
it does not tell you how does the brain or
what neural factors play role into this particular

507
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,870
whole structure so this has this is basically
this kind of process models are basically

508
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:56,660
influenced by the behaviors which believe
that the input output sequence is what is

509
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,450
of important to us but what is inside is not
of importance to us

510
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:05,330
and so it does not give you the brain structures
the brain processes which actually go ahead

511
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:11,430
and lead to the fa final answer of comparisons
or final comparisons that are done and so

512
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,680
to counter that neural network models were
done or thought of now what are the neural

513
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,060
ma network model it relies on interconnected
units which has not just input output units

514
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,550
but it has a hidden hidden unit which is generally
called the brain unit into it and so most

515
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,320
inputs are connected to a hidden unit and
the hidden unit are further connected to an

516
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,730
output unit so if i encoding ah if a input
unit is given this input unit then goes ahead

517
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,400
and makes connections with this hidden units
which are generally neurons

518
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,860
now this type of ah ah neural network structure
that i am showing you is a simple feed forward

519
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,400
network what happens here is there are three
units l one l two and three three which inputs

520
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,020
which have been taken and these inputs are
then compared or then processed through h

521
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:07,170
one h two h three three different brain ah
networks or neuronal networks now each of

522
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:15,320
this network can have only two activity one
is either it can be excitatory which is the

523
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,980
i response or inhibitory of response

524
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:26,410
so when a particular input a particular representation
from the environment is encoded this particular

525
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:33,040
network or this particular respon ah neuronal
network will either be excitatory will either

526
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,131
passed along with either move along this information
to the next network and show a connection

527
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:43,740
or it could show inhibitory whereas it will
not ah process this information further

528
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:51,080
also these connections that the input layer
or the input item has with the hidden layer

529
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,280
has weights into it and depending on what
weight it is what is the strength of this

530
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,930
connection will decide whether this inhab
whether this response of excitation or inhibition

531
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:09,930
will these ah will this hidden units actually
show and based on the excitatory or inhibitory

532
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:16,810
input or mode of the hidden layer and the
weights of the input layer the output layer

533
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:24,550
is finally or the outputs are finally determined
and so that is how we see that l one or i

534
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:30,960
one represents gives to give rise to o two
and the hidden layer the neural network or

535
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,160
the group of neurons which actually process
it how does it really function

536
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:43,110
so this particular model shows us gives us
several ah benefit for example it it it shows

537
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:49,390
us what are the neural codes which are there
which are which are ah which are responsible

538
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:54,010
for this kind of an output and it distinguishes
this neural codes for mental representations

539
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:59,890
so it does not just tell you mental representation
of how a event is represented in in memory

540
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,800
but also what are the brain states or what
are the neuron of the states which are processing

541
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,540
this particular neuronal unit

542
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:16,420
so that brings us to the end of this session
and to do a quick recap in this session what

543
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:23,190
we did was we looked at the different methods
of studying cognition and we looked at the

544
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:29,440
heart of this ah study the use of different
methods that the the basic point being that

545
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,030
as we use different methods we get several
whatever the ah the loophole from one method

546
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,680
turns out to be the benefit from another method
and so we get a more comprehensive picture

547
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,350
if one method explains process a but cannot
explain process b may be there is another

548
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,500
method which can explain process b and ah
comes up with another limitations and so looking

549
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,210
at the benefits and limitations of all these
methods give us a more complete picture of

550
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,760
how cognitive or cognitive processes develop

551
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:05,150
and so within that we looked at four different
types of ah methods or four different ah techniques

552
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:10,890
of studying cognition right from behavioral
techniques where we look at accuracy response

553
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:18,290
time judgments and protocol to coming up ah
with techniques which actually go ahead and

554
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:23,550
localize or pinpoint a br brain area which
is active when a particular mental process

555
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:30,000
is being carried out and ah the methods like
e e g p e t m m r i or f m r i and optical

556
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
imaging to looking at ca casual methods which
actually disrupt a brain area which is believed

557
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,820
to be active when a particular event is being
taking place or ventricular mental event is

558
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:47,610
being taking place to the methods of ah modeling
where ah a process is designed a computer

559
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,870
stimulation is designed which mimics what
the brain does

560
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:56,750
so instead of studying the brain itself um
um a mimic or a model of that is done and

561
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,960
studied in a through computer stimulations
to find out ah what will happen if a particular

562
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:08,020
input or a particular group of brains ah brain
areas ah which which are known to respond

563
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:13,200
in particular ways if they take in an information
how what is the possible output that can come

564
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,900
in

565
00:57:19,900 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you
