1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:36,879
you so in the last lecture we looked at ah
some of the basic processes of cognitive psychology

2
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,360
we looked at what cognitive psychology is
composed of we looked at the schools which

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,670
led to the development of cognitive psychology
is a field we look at the subject matter of

4
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:53,540
cognitive psychology in terms of mental representations
what are mental representations what do they

5
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,270
represent how do they combine together to
find knowledge and how mental representations

6
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,470
are manipulated the way they can be expressed
the way they can be understood

7
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:18,380
in this lecture we look at why brain is to
be brought into the idea of cognitive psychology

8
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,100
up till now we have been looking at mental
processes and we have been looking at mental

9
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,740
representations and the functions of mental
representations we are looking at how mental

10
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,020
representations function
but the idea of cognitive psychology in terms

11
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:42,869
of what behavior is said or in terms of what
cognitive is said proposed that mental representations

12
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:50,030
explain functions the process of how they
combine together explain functions of a of

13
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,270
how mental activities take place is not enough
so at the inception of cognitive psychology

14
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,580
it was all about the functional aspect of
how mental representations make up mental

15
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,530
activity and mental knowledge
now one of the co challenges one of the main

16
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,780
challenges of cognitive psychology is to understand
what happens in the mind and how does the

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,560
mind does what it does the conception of the
mind have been differently put by different

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,030
people philosophers have given one way of
what mind is psychologists have understood

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,220
mind in more in terms of consciousness understanding
consciousness and the go through the cognitive

20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,090
revolution the understanding of the mind ah
was put down to or brought down to the understanding

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,750
of mental representations understanding mental
processes mentally ah activities and so on

22
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,600
and so forth
up till now till the cognitive revolution

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,420
the study of mental processes the the study
of mental activity the study of cognition

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:04,090
which is basically the study of mental activities
was in terms of functions but the mind cannot

25
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:12,870
work on its own and so it it is the the idea
of mind and brain as a computer hardware and

26
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:21,230
software introduces first the first time brain
as the act system on which the mind works

27
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,810
and so one of the most interesting fact that
has been bought or that has been thought of

28
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,380
as by cognitive psychologists is introduction
of the brain in the whole idea of study of

29
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,400
mental processes of how mental events takes
place

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,390
the question is why do we study the brain
what help will we get looking at the brain

31
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:51,130
it is composed of different neurons neural
grooves and these neural grooves have biological

32
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:57,190
structure and so at the sight of it it does
not appeal or it does not ah give us much

33
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,280
information about mental processes or the
functioning of the mind

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:12,490
so why should we actually look at the brain
looking at the brain will help us identify

35
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:21,220
those processes and the correct combination
of processes that are required to complete

36
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,840
a task what does that mean what it would mean
is that since the brain leads to the mind

37
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:36,070
the working of the mind the process of the
mind will have a direct impact or would directly

38
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,450
project to the brain and so changes in brain
structure changes in brain activity can then

39
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:51,800
be correlated to the of the mind think of
it in this way and this is a very ah blow

40
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,840
not example
suppose a region a of the brain activates

41
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,900
when a certain mental processes takes place
and it does not activate it does not show

42
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:16,880
activity when a certain b mental process takes
place then now we have an observable a quantifiable

43
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,750
fact or a quantifiable system on which we
can look at changes because these brain activities

44
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,120
the the increase and decrease of brain activities
will signal whether process a is working or

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,750
whether process b is working
and so one of the ah reasons of including

46
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,180
the brain or bringing up the brain into the
whole idea of study of cognitive psychology

47
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:47,550
is to identify because brain helps us in identifying
what mental processes are taking place if

48
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,530
we are able to form correlations between mental
activity and brain activity but then there

49
00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:04,530
is a catch to it what is the catch different
information processes they lead to the same

50
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:12,540
kind of mental experience
what i am trying to tell you here think of

51
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:20,200
emotions now there is a correlation between
a brain region which is the amygdala and the

52
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,750
kind of emotion that people have and so if
i am looking at an happy emotion or if i am

53
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,270
looking at positive emotion what will happen
is that most on most positive emotions the

54
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,810
same or nearly same brain regions will actually
activate or show activity

55
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:48,820
so how do i go ahead and pinpoint those brain
networks which lead to the happiness or sadness

56
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:56,910
factor also there is no way to tell us how
does the brain did use or give labels to these

57
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,009
emotions whether this is excited this is happy
and this activity leads to this kind of emotional

58
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:11,830
ah feeling
so then the different sort of information

59
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:20,389
processes can produce similar results or can
produce similar kind of act as in ah in outputs

60
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,160
is one of the basic problems by including
of including the brain so one of the problems

61
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,979
is that also there is a problem which is called
the structure process trade off why does it

62
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,990
mean this is the same thing that i was trying
to explain you a little while ago what is

63
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:53,750
the structure process trade off i try to explain
this to you in a very easy way saul stonberg

64
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:05,020
sternberg sorry was trying to identify how
people search mentally what is the process

65
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:13,460
people use for doing mental search and for
that he gave people students volunteers experiments

66
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:24,100
so the in the first conceptualization what
sternberg was trying to do 

67
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:38,690
was trying to find out how information is
accessed from memory any conceptualized so

68
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,289
an experiment which he gave to volunteers
the experiment was like this

69
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:48,959
certain numbers were given to people for example
numbers one three five seven and nine and

70
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:57,350
nine and later on these people once these
numbers were shown to them later on these

71
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,550
numbers were shown to them one by one and
they were asked to tell with confidence whether

72
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,939
these numbers were in the list or not so it
is like a list recognition

73
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:13,749
so what happens in this experiment is this
list of number was given to people to remember

74
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:19,269
to learn and once the learning was over one
by one these numbers are presented and they

75
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,449
were asked to decide they were asked to recognize
whether each of these numbers represent in

76
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:34,959
the list or not what he conceptualized is
that this kind of list excess memory excess

77
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,670
happens through serial search and why did
he ah why did he propose that he found out

78
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:59,829
that as the list increases the verification
time also increases so list increases the

79
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:03,309
length of the list increases the verification
time also increases

80
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:08,369
what he found out from his studies well that
information excess from memory was in a serial

81
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:13,459
way so what happens is that when once you
show this list to people people formed a mental

82
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:19,730
image of this and then later on when you show
one of these members of the list and ask them

83
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,929
to verify from their mental image or from
the mental representation whether this is

84
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:30,350
present or not we what people tend to do is
match this with this if the match of this

85
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,279
with this results in a yes response the search
is terminated

86
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:43,149
if it is not you get a negative response here
and so the search goes to the next item whether

87
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:49,079
this and these are similar it is not so search
goes to the third item not match again not

88
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,129
match again not match the list returns to
the first item verifies it again and then

89
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,459
gives an output saying that it was not present
in the list and this is a serial search so

90
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:09,119
what happens is one item at the same time
list two is matched to the list and that gives

91
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:14,269
this kind of a serial search system
and so obviously as the number of items will

92
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,989
increase the verification time will increase
because this serial searches have to be more

93
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:26,920
in number this was what saul sternberg proposed
and this is how what he said is the reason

94
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:37,350
for accessing or how information is accessing
memory but later on people like townsend gave

95
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:56,929
a different conceptualization of information
accessing from memory what did townsend say

96
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,980
townsend said that the the same conceptualization
that i have the same problem can i that i

97
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:14,489
have can be thought of as balls 
in a plate and so now i have one three seven

98
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:21,449
four and nine
and instead of a serial search what really

99
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,930
happens is information is searched through
parallel processes information access from

100
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,199
memory is done through parallel processes
now if that is true if parallel processes

101
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:45,230
occur in the memory then adding new items
into this list for example two and eight should

102
00:12:45,230 --> 00:13:01,610
not increase the time of verification as list
length increases this is not what was found

103
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:12,230
what townsend found that as the number of
balls the number of item increases the time

104
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,869
of verification also increases
so how do i confer it for a serial search

105
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:27,619
it was accounted in terms of the fact that
more number of processes are there and more

106
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:32,899
structure is in so as the number of processes
increases oh sorry the number of searches

107
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:42,379
increases the time will increase but in this
case when i have parallel searches here the

108
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:52,620
same structure in the same structure the number
of items are there but still the time of verification

109
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,249
increases how do i confer this
they counting further this is done in terms

110
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:12,639
of the number of processes that take place
what happens is in serial search 

111
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:28,779
although the process of verification is single
but the structure that stores this information

112
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,290
is a bigger structure and so what happens
is although the process is a single process

113
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,299
since the structure is more or there is a
bigger structure which stores this information

114
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:43,129
the time of verification will increase because
as i add up more items into it more structure

115
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:54,170
is required
on the other hand parallel search 

116
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,209
although the structure is same but the number
of processes that are there the number of

117
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,720
comparisons that have to should be done the
number of processes takes up for the or accounts

118
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,569
for the more time what will happen is since
there are lets let us assume that there are

119
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,709
four process processes which run in parallel
what will happen is these four processes will

120
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:24,600
have to do multiple evaluations and these
multiple evaluations although this is much

121
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,269
faster but these multiple evaluations are
the reason for the increase in verification

122
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:38,859
time and so the inclusion of the brain the
inclusion of the idea of the brain gives us

123
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:47,089
a chance to identify what is the reason for
the mental ah activity or what is the reason

124
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:54,329
how this mental activity is taking place
another interesting thing is the idiocracy

125
00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:03,549
theory is the requirement of idiocracy what
does it say the inclusion of the brain into

126
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:10,459
the understanding of mental processing or
mental processes gives us this chance to understand

127
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:18,380
what necessary or what adequate processes
or what requirements are there for certain

128
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:27,540
mental process to take place what does this
mean it means that if four different processes

129
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:36,499
or if four different answers of a particular
way a particular process through which a mental

130
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:44,619
experiences felt is being proposed given the
structural constraint of the brain which of

131
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:50,470
them will be the most correct what do i mean
by this

132
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:57,160
in the first part i have explained that multiple
processes will give the same result but how

133
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,619
do i go ahead and look at which of this is
the most optimal or which of this is the most

134
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:08,270
optimal theory the best theories or best thought
of theories because there will be several

135
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,450
theories there will be several reasons of
how the mental process appear and so what

136
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:19,740
the idiocracy laws will tell us is that given
the constraints of the brain given the constraints

137
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,270
of what the brain has or what structures of
the brain are which of the theory explains

138
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:35,190
the processing or the answer to a mental process
or the output to a mental process

139
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,950
and so idiocracy laws says that brain inclusion
of the brain will help us in pinpointing which

140
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,550
theory works in which theory does not and
what should be done for theories or what changes

141
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,920
could be done in a theory to adjust it so
that it explains a menl mental phenomena

142
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,860
now there are certain paradigms to the study
of cognitive psychology first of all let us

143
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,550
understand what a paradigm is it is a body
of knowledge structured according to what

144
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:12,630
is proponents consider important and what
they do not so it is basically what should

145
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:23,330
be the basic idea behind cognitive psychology
or what what is the ah basic matter behind

146
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:30,770
cognitive psychology and so this these paradigms
are assumptions which are made by investigators

147
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:36,320
appropriate types of research methods because
these paradigms then when i use a particular

148
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,500
paradigm when i use a particular approach
to study cognitive psychology it will not

149
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,630
only give leaders to having a set of assumptions
which vary across paradigms but it also gave

150
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:56,010
us different methods of research of the same
different processes or the same mental process

151
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:02,430
it will also give new questions in the field
so the same processes same mental process

152
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,790
or same mental activities if it is studied
by different paradigms if it is studied by

153
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,680
different approaches not only will it give
us different types of research methods of

154
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,290
having same process but it would also give
us new questions and also new analog is to

155
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:26,590
it or new ah similar problems to it of how
the solutions can be generated and so in cognitive

156
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:33,380
psychology there are four basic paradigm that
i wish to make you aware of here

157
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,960
the first paradigm is called the information
processing approach and so this approach started

158
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:47,700
with the cognitive revolution the part of
this approach this approach comes from the

159
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,620
structure list and what this approach says
is that cognition is basically information

160
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:03,100
passing through a system so there are several
systems out there seres several ah process

161
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:11,280
systems in in the mind and these process systems
takes in information from a previous process

162
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,220
a processing system and passes processes it
in certain way and passes it along to the

163
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,010
next system
and so information processing approach says

164
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,870
that cognitive psychology the subject matter
of cognitive psychology should be how how

165
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:33,110
these systems process information the basic
information processing approach is built in

166
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:42,260
this way it says that any information which
comes out or which people encounter from the

167
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:51,670
environment is first detected so this is the
environment and this environment provides

168
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:58,800
certain signals or certain kind of information
and this information is detected by the mind

169
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:07,450
or by the brain using a process called attention
this attention then separates the different

170
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:16,150
formats of information which are passed on
from the environment so the information which

171
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,400
is passed on from the environment could be
in visual medium it could be an auditory medium

172
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,380
or it could mean olfactory medium or the other
two senses which is heptic or the taste gustatory

173
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:36,530
once these different formats or this different
types of information is detected by the human

174
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:42,050
system through process of ah attention it
is passed on to something called a short term

175
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:50,100
memory and what is short term memory its a
system or its a place where information which

176
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:58,760
is taken in through a process of perception
using attention is thrown here or is put here

177
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:07,420
for storage now this storage system is a temporary
storage and so if people do not rehearse this

178
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:15,430
information do not go ahead and repeat this
information it is lost here through forgetting

179
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,490
if it is rehearsed it goes back to something
called long term memory also information which

180
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,690
is coming out from the environment is first
recognized through perception so perception

181
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:33,230
has certain filters and these filters are
three these basic modules will recognize different

182
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:38,530
information which is coming from the environment
i am talking about here the content so based

183
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,880
on the content the information is stored in
short term memory from the short term memory

184
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,660
it is rehearsed it goes to long term memory
once the information comes into long term

185
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:56,590
memory this is basically categorized into
already so existing information ah systems

186
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,560
or information places in the long term memory
so mostly long term memory has a very categorical

187
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,180
structure
since long term memory has a lot of information

188
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:16,150
to into it so what it does is it categorizes
information 

189
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:24,720
into different categories what are these categories
these categories are generally formed through

190
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:36,170
something called schema if it is episodic
knowledge or it if it is semantic knowledge

191
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:43,750
this categorization is done through something
called hierarchical tree structure what you

192
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,780
need to understand here is that this long
term memory takes in information from short

193
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,590
term memory and it binds this information
which is coming from short term memory into

194
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:59,770
already existing long term memory information
for example the next time you see an apple

195
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,480
you do not need to learn that this is an apple
what happens is when an apple is presented

196
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:13,340
to you this apple is perceived by your perceptual
system the perceptual system identifies a

197
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:21,910
scale color shape and these kind of informations
texture passes on to short term memory the

198
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,310
short term memory takes this information ask
the long term memory in terms of given the

199
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,050
fact that this is the format and this is the
meaning or this is the kind of information

200
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,610
that is coming from this structure or this
mental representation what could could be

201
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,640
the long term memory then compares this information
and tells you that this is an apple

202
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:50,640
or if tomorrow a black apple comes in now
when i taste it when i see it it looks like

203
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,960
an apple but the possibility of black apple
is not there so what the brain will do is

204
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,390
take this black colored apple compare it with
features which are existing in in the long

205
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,560
term memory and so since the black apple has
most of the features which is si similar to

206
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,020
any other apple only the color is different
so what will happen is this black apple now

207
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,180
gets stored up or gets included into the category
of apple which are already stored in long

208
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,080
term memory with one pointer to it or with
one exception to it saying that this is a

209
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,880
black color apple because most apples are
green and red in color so this is a unique

210
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,020
feature which says that it is black in color
so this is what the information processing

211
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,950
approach says it says that any information
comes in or it passes through certain stages

212
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:47,660
and these stages define how an information
or mental ah mental activity defines how an

213
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:54,230
information path is processed through this
system now the information processing approach

214
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:04,470
tells us about the systems the processes and
the goals what is the systems here the various

215
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:15,500
systems which help in the processing of information
are the sensory memory here the short term

216
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,450
memory here the long term memory here what
are the processes which help us in in understanding

217
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,880
this mental experience or in sending mental
activity our processes recognition rehearsal

218
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,350
recording reorganization manipulation categorization
and so on and so forth and what are the goals

219
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,710
of it the goal is the response the goal is
the understanding

220
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,430
so in the apple example the processes which
help us and understanding the apple is the

221
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,450
short term memory the long term memory the
perceptual systems those are the processes

222
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,220
what are the sorry those are the structures
those are the systems the processes are the

223
00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:00,000
process of encoding the process of recognition
the process of rehearsal the process of ah

224
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,850
ah response manipulation the process of identification
recognition these are the process through

225
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:12,140
which you identify this apple and the response
the output is storage of a new kind of apple

226
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,750
the response output is the information the
knowledge that a black apple also exists this

227
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,760
is the goal though the goal is to understand
that that can only be cal can also be black

228
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:32,460
is achieved through a system of processes
the second paradigm which has been used or

229
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:39,870
which is popular in cognitive psychology is
connectivism what is connectivism now connectivism

230
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,580
is also known as parallel distributed processing
model and what it says is that there are several

231
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,170
small units which are connected together and
these connections lead to the formation of

232
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,740
mental experience
in the information processing approach we

233
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,890
saw certain systems interacting with certain
processes to give a particular kind of a goal

234
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,130
in connectionism what happens is there are
several small units and these small units

235
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,530
connect to each other through certle connect
connections and these connections later on

236
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:23,450
lead to the formation of mental experience
how does this connectionism works

237
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:30,760
the basic fundamental premise of this connectionism
theory is that individual neurons in the brain

238
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:40,350
they do not transmit large amounts of symbolic
information but instead they compute or they

239
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:47,760
come up with the goal by being appropriately
connected to large number of situational units

240
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,110
so what is the meaning of this it means that
there are specialized systems and these specialized

241
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,881
systems are connected to each other and these
connections lead to the idea of mental process

242
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:13,670
for example lets 
understand how this particular sentence robin

243
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:24,520
is a bird the mental experience to this is
explained by connectionism look at robin this

244
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:33,110
is our name it is a kind of bird and so if
you look on this side of it it falls from

245
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:41,390
the category of birds so there are robin a
canary sunfish salomon all these are birds

246
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:47,050
and these fall under the living things living
things have ah are further divided into plants

247
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,390
and animal then into trees and flowers bird
fish and so on and so forth so basically on

248
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:57,940
this side you have a system of connections
through which in which you have categorization

249
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,270
in terms of living nonliving birds animals
and so on and so forth and so robin forms

250
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:11,120
robin goes here the name robin goes here
is or is a is basically a connector which

251
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:22,150
defines what is the relation of robin to the
word bird and once robin which is a bird is

252
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:32,230
connected to three to this connection of is
a we can then say that if the mental experience

253
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,900
of robin is a bird can then conclude or can
give then can give us the idea that since

254
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:48,760
robin is a bird it should have wings it should
be able to fly why because the idea that bird

255
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,190
falls under the category of living things
and living things certain features of living

256
00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:00,309
things are there and these live certain features
should be present on any member of living

257
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:04,250
things
so bird is a member of living things and so

258
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,679
everything that is there in the living thing
should be present in bird so robin should

259
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:16,860
robin which is basically a bird should be
living should be locomoting should be ah doing

260
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,900
daily activities and certain features of the
bird should also be present in them

261
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,510
the basic idea and connection is is that it
is not big processes it is not big systems

262
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,380
and process the connection between big processes
and systems which leads to the formation of

263
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,390
mental ah activity or mental experience but
there are several connections between several

264
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,680
networks which are there there as there is
a network of what a bird looks like there

265
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,450
is a network of what if there is a bird what
is the basic feature of the bird and so on

266
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,640
and so forth and this is how connections are
so small units small amount of units or small

267
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:01,220
units combine together to give us the mental
experience now these units which combine with

268
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:07,090
each other to give us the kind of experience
that trees where that we get when we talk

269
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:13,850
about robbing is a bird it they have certain
weights and so weight wise combination will

270
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:20,330
tell us what features should robin have
now we will discuss connectionism the idea

271
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:26,470
of connectionism in detail in the chapter
of memory where we look into ah what is semantic

272
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:32,200
memory and what is the parallel distributing
model there and how symbolic ah the hierarchy

273
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,850
structure of symbolic memory is and those
things there but the basic difference between

274
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,559
connectionism and information processing approaches
in information processing approach there is

275
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,550
one system there is a set of there is a set
of system and set of processes which leads

276
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:53,480
to the goal but whereas in connectionism several
units several independent units they combined

277
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,120
together to give us the mental experience
the third approach to studying of cognitive

278
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,590
psychology is called the evolutionary approach
now what this approach does it says that the

279
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:11,679
study of mental processes through the ways
in which the i p model the information processing

280
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:19,940
model and connectivism connectivist models
look at they basically do not count for evolutionary

281
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:27,170
features or evolutionary approaches evolutionary
inputs to our understanding of cognitive psychology

282
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:32,570
so what they say is cognitive psych subjective
matter of cognitive psychology is not how

283
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,650
mental processes are studying off mental process
how mental process a process but there are

284
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:45,960
certain specialized competence which comes
through evolutionary input for example basic

285
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,640
cognitive abilities like language and three
dimensional perception of perception of depth

286
00:33:51,640 --> 00:34:00,940
are present in very small children and they
do not need some kind of mental experience

287
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,880
for them to develop that
and so what evolutionary approach says that

288
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,339
human beings they have very specialized ideas
of completeness produced by our evolutionary

289
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:13,810
heritage evolution has a role to play in cognitive
psychology so the subject matter of cognitive

290
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:19,029
psychology the view the way of looking at
what cognitive psychology should study should

291
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:24,559
not only be the study of mental processes
and thoughts it should also be how evolution

292
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,859
has made us think in certain ways or behave
in certain ways

293
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:37,529
what they say the evolutionary approaches
say is that the human mind is basically a

294
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:48,079
biological system that has evolved over generations
and the development of the human mind has

295
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,020
come through a process of natural selection
so certain features or certain aspects certain

296
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:04,589
working of the human mind or the human brain
is inbuilt is evolutionary in nature and nature

297
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:12,380
has given us this ah kind of system to process
information

298
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,049
so basically then the evolutionary approach
will use evolutionary as one of the reason

299
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:26,160
of mental experience and one of the ah basic
views or one of the basic wa ways of looking

300
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,819
at how mental experiences are processed and
similar to that is the last approach which

301
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:40,190
is called the ecological approach the ecological
approach goes ahead and says that mental experiences

302
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:50,349
or cognition does not occur in isolation all
cognitive activities take place in certain

303
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:56,190
context and so contexts are very important
in studying cognition

304
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,799
so just studying the mental processes or what
is going in the brain what is going on in

305
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:06,109
the mind how the brain or what the brain does
or what mental experiences are what kind of

306
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:12,900
processes and systems make up certain kind
of ah ah certain kind of mental mental experience

307
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,849
should not be the only way of looking at cognition
of how cognition happens but one way of looking

308
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:26,430
at cognition or one viewpoint of looking at
cognition is also in terms of the ecology

309
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:35,069
or the culture in which people live because
culture has only a ah large role to play of

310
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:40,920
how information is processed certain cultures
do not allow information probe to be processed

311
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,749
in certain ways certain cultures allow information
to be cert certain ah process in certain ways

312
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:51,789
and that leads to the different kind of information
processing or different kind of thinking

313
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:57,099
think of the individualistic and the cult
and the collectivist culture the kind of culture

314
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,589
that the westerners have individualistic in
nature and the kind of culture that we have

315
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:10,089
here the asian countries have is more collectivist
nature and so the way the mental processes

316
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:19,759
the cognition of people who live in the west
are entirely different from the way we live

317
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:28,099
in our country because we have a collectivist
culture the reason is that from right on right

318
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:34,309
very beginning they the westerners are taught
to be individualistic taught to be alone taught

319
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:38,799
to be doing things on their own and so they
process information in an entirely different

320
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:45,410
way whereas the as in as asians since we live
in a collectivist culture what really happens

321
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:51,231
is the way we perceive information is always
in terms of how the whole society will look

322
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:55,619
into it
so basically then the clo ecological approach

323
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,950
says is that all collect cognitive activities
are shaped by the culture and context in which

324
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:09,200
they occur and so this brings an end to the
base the first section of where we looked

325
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:16,230
at the history of cognitive psychology the
subject matter of cognitive psychology the

326
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,019
various paradigms of cognitive psychology
of what it should be the what is the subject

327
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:27,329
matter what is the content what kind of things
are studied into it what kind of ah processes

328
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:35,099
are there and what is the input output kind
of a system this is the basic introduction

329
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:43,089
to the history of cognitive psychology
in upcoming lecture what we look into is how

330
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:51,289
do we study cognition now as i said cognition
is the mental process processing of mental

331
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:56,930
activities or mental representations so how
do we study this processing how do we study

332
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:02,109
this cognition in action is what we will do
in next lecture and from there on will slowly

333
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:09,450
move on to other cognitive processes or basic
cognitive processes such as perception things

334
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:16,220
like attention things like memory this decision
making and so on so forth

335
00:39:16,220 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you
