00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:30,579
hello 

2
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,650
i am naveen kashyap and i teach ah psychology
at indian institute of technology gauwhati

3
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,680
ah one of the subjects in psychology that
i teach here is cognitive psychology and so

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,020
i will be teaching you this course
this course on cognitive psychology ah will

5
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,479
be covered through eight modules we will start
with introduction to the history of psychology

6
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:02,939
cognitive psychology then moving on to ah
the methods of studying cognitive psychology

7
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:09,500
we will ah deal with perception the basic
process of taking in information then moving

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:18,040
to attention the filter or the barrier which
which lets information gets encoded

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,750
from there we will move into how whatever
information has been perceived or taken in

10
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:31,130
into our system how that is ah stored as memories
further on we will look into what are memories

11
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:38,140
what are the type of memories which are there
how many processes operate ah things like

12
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,850
how processes of encoding and retrieval really
work and what is the way in which information

13
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,049
is organized in in memory
once you are done with memory we will move

14
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:57,450
into something called thinking which is a
higher order cognitive processes and which

15
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:06,610
draws on from memory now thinking is a process
which will lead on to something called decision

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:14,421
making another important proper process in
cognition which is central to ah the idea

17
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:21,230
of how people ah actually make decisions in
real life or how people decide or make choices

18
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,200
in real life
we will also be venturing into a little bit

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,980
into something called language ah which is
how people ah use signs and symbols to communicate

20
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,440
ah ideas between them because communication
of ideas or whatever one thinks whatever cognition

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,700
ones have sharing that cognition with other
people is also ah central to the idea of psychology

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,830
so let us then move ah quickly into ah a brief
history of cognitive psychology psychology

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:08,060
developed from philosophy it came out of philosophy
and philosophers ah where the people who actually

24
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,440
first proposed a how knowledge is stored how
knowledge is dealt and how knowledge is acquired

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,890
and so they led to the development of the
science which is ah psychology and so before

26
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:31,520
moving on to the history of cognitive psychology
ah lets look at a a a brief history of the

27
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,931
philosophical inputs to cognitive psychology
so one of the brief inputs of philosophy or

28
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:44,900
one of the brief debates of philosophy which
led to the science of development of cognitive

29
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,160
psychology ah was the debate on something
called nativism and empiricism what is this

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:59,480
debate
empiricism explains that knowledge the idea

31
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,790
of knowledge or the idea of how knowledge
gets stored it comes from individuals experiences

32
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,890
so individual so their own experience to their
own interaction with people around them with

33
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:18,720
society around them or through memories or
through or other kind of experiencing systems

34
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,289
ah generate knowledge
whereas the nativist believed that the role

35
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:35,229
of heredity the role of biology or the role
of constitutional factors are responsible

36
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:42,190
for the generation of knowledge so what was
the debate all about on the empresses side

37
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:52,810
we have people like ah aristotle and people
like john locke now john locke for one who

38
00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:01,780
was an en ah english philosopher ah from sixteen
thirty two to seventeen o four he talked about

39
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,960
knowledge or the basic of cognitive psychology
in terms of contents of the mind

40
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:16,600
so what is the content of mind and he said
that mind compose of thoughts it comprises

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,300
of thoughts and these thoughts are mental
images a series of mental images which are

42
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,740
associated together and they are what mind
is all about or knowledge is all about also

43
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:37,880
john locke proposed the idea that people at
the time of birth bo are born with a blank

44
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,930
state of mind so there is nothing written
in the mind itself and this debate that this

45
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,130
blank state or this idea that is bank state
with experience or true experience get written

46
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:55,570
up and that makes knowledge or that develops
knowledge or cognitions

47
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,610
similarly aristotle had a similar viewpoint
where he believe that personal experiences

48
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:13,720
of people is the reason how ah this knowledge
develops on the other hand people like plato

49
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:21,080
or people starting with plato other people
like rene descartes they believed that knowledge

50
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,270
actually comes from heredity or it comes from
the ah composition or biology and so they

51
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,790
basically are the descendants or they basically
progress from darwins point of view they believe

52
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:43,310
that knowledge is inbuilt or it comes as an
inbuilt mechanism and ah the fact that this

53
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,600
inbuilt mechanism is ah as the reason for
knowledge

54
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,229
specific to cognitive psychology rene descartes
who was a french philosopher he gave this

55
00:06:53,229 --> 00:07:00,240
idea of mind and body plato believed that
memory is the first use of plato where that

56
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,460
memories were actually writings which were
on a wax tablet and he believed that this

57
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,639
mind that people have is actually a wax tablet
and the writings on this tablet is what our

58
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,120
memories and so what he goes ahead and says
is that these memories the way these memories

59
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,139
are written the way these writings are the
wax tablet the strength of these writings

60
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:33,000
actually explain or actually tell you how
strong or weak a memory is also the content

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,470
of this what is written on this wax tablet
will tell you about the content of memories

62
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:45,870
now the idea of john locke that this mental
images the series of mental images are actually

63
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,670
what are the contents of mind was contested
by someone called george berkeley now what

64
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:58,550
is george berkeley say he contested the idea
that thought processes or contents of the

65
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,039
mind cannot be mental images which are associated
together

66
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,979
the reasoning that he gave to this was that
abstract ideas like judgment or like truth

67
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:16,180
this cannot be conceptualized as mental images
as they cannot lead to this idea of the mental

68
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,919
images and so these were some of the ah some
of the basic ah philosophically passions or

69
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,490
philosophical view points of what psychology
ah in general and cognitive psychology in

70
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,679
special or in in particular are actually ah
comprised of or should comprise of

71
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:42,879
with the coming of someone con william wundt
in the year eighteen seventy nine the first

72
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:51,129
scientific school of psychology developed
william wundt developed this school at a place

73
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:59,360
in leipzig in germany and with his school
the first structural school of psychology

74
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,220
came into being the basic things or the basic
ideas that william wundt actually went ahead

75
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,440
and studied where the nature of consciousness
what is consciousness in the nature of consciousness

76
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:21,499
now consciousness as such has been one of
the basic materials or one of the basic ah

77
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:29,370
inputs which are the ah which are the subject
matter of cognitive psychology so what william

78
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,089
wundt was trying to do as a scientist as a
scientific school of psychology was studying

79
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,449
what consciousness is all about
for the first time william wundt was able

80
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:48,879
to explain psychology with a scientific viewpoint
now what was this scientific viewpoint and

81
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,259
what was william wundt actually trying to
do william wundt believe that any psychological

82
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,579
process can actually be broken down into sub
processes

83
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:10,079
now this idea of breaking a mental process
into his basic process is actually a hangover

84
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,809
which comes from the physical sciences and
since william wundt came from the basic sciences

85
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:22,970
this breaking of the mental process into sub
processes were actually hangover which he

86
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:32,670
had and what did he believe now william wundt
basically approached or described consciousness

87
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:40,410
as to ah two part system one he said that
cons describing a consciousness will require

88
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:47,269
two things characterizing the basic sensations
which is what are the sensations which characterize

89
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:54,380
the mental process things like ah the heat
the color the texture of the of the particular

90
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,879
ah ah sensation and also characterizing the
feeling what is the feeling associated with

91
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:09,949
now as you can see in this particular slide
what william wundt would want is to study

92
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:19,119
mental processes or mental ideas using the
basic ah process of of the hard sciences like

93
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:25,689
chemistry and physics on this slide you can
see that there is a structure of a ah chemical

94
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:32,899
or organic chemical compound and as you can
see this organic chemical compound is ah basically

95
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,139
composes of several parts and this chemical
compound in itself can be described by the

96
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,259
parts of our elements or ah the ba the elements
which comprising

97
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:48,370
what william wundt was attempting to do is
to study the idea of seeing this apple the

98
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,989
consciousness of staying this apple and break
it into processes greatly into basic processes

99
00:11:54,989 --> 00:12:01,300
of how people see this apple as you can see
on the right hand side there is an apple and

100
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,759
there is a process to it
now the very ba the basic idea of apple what

101
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:13,709
william wundt said is comprised of these five
or six ideas what is the idea for example

102
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,750
it can be described the apple can be described
in color of in in terms of its color in terms

103
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:28,029
of its taste in terms of its of shape in terms
of its shine or in terms of how you feel after

104
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,929
eating it and that is what i was talking about
so what william wundt did was the idea or

105
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:41,839
the consciousness or the concept of apple
the mental image of apple the ah mental construct

106
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,109
of apple he described can be described over
can be broken down into its physical features

107
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:53,929
which is the shape color texture and things
like that and the feeling that we have after

108
00:12:53,929 --> 00:13:01,139
eating an apple or how do we feel after eating
a particular apple

109
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,470
and the second thing is he also wanted they
also included so one thing was characterizing

110
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,850
the feeling and ah the basic sensations and
the second part of this was to deal with the

111
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,019
rules through which these sensations were
combined together what are the rules which

112
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:24,189
through which we combine the perceptions the
idea of an apple and the feeling of an apple

113
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:28,910
and so he he related that this could be done
through perception where in perception we

114
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,499
actually not only see the color shape and
size we combine them together to see a whole

115
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:37,079
apple
so in all what william wundt was trying to

116
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:45,620
do is trying to explain mental processes in
terms of the sensations or the the sensation

117
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,889
and feelings and also how these sensations
and feelings combined together to give you

118
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:58,819
the actual construct or the actual im ah image
of an apple this notion of taking a mental

119
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:06,929
image or taking a ah ah ah mental feeling
and breaking it into its part this led to

120
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:15,489
two major things
one he showed that mental activity mental

121
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:24,299
images can be broken down into basic operations
so when i see something or when i feel something

122
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:33,209
the feeling of a particular sunrise or sunset
can be broken down into its physical part

123
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:37,179
which is the heat that i feel or the cold
that i feel or the kind of feeling that i

124
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:44,879
feel and also the basic factors the basic
temperature the basic light intensity which

125
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,669
the sun gives off at sunset i would combine
these two two things together and then i get

126
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,989
this mental activity or the mental feeling
of what a sunset is

127
00:14:52,989 --> 00:15:01,189
and this is the second thing that ah william
wundt was able to do was to develop an objective

128
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:07,309
method of studying mental activity up till
now most philosophers are talking about mental

129
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:13,410
activity as a process as etching on a tablet
or it could be in terms of consciousness but

130
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,389
none of these things could actually be studied
objectively could actually be studied or could

131
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:25,109
actually be measured as changes but what william
wundt did was take a mental activity was to

132
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:31,839
take from this mental activity and divide
it into its parts which can be measured and

133
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:39,049
which can which are observable in nature so
this is the the this is the contribution of

134
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:48,110
william wundt the problem with what william
wundt suggested was that mental images does

135
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:57,889
not gain guarantee a mental activity and so
the study of mental images in no way will

136
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:04,449
guarantee the study of mental activity
for example lets say i give you different

137
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:11,350
weights and ask you to compare two weights
one is ah lighter or whether one is lighter

138
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,720
than the other or when one is heavier than
the other its an easy task and most people

139
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:26,160
will be able to do it but the question is
do people actually realize that they are doing

140
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,029
this comparison or are people able to basically
center on those mental activities which are

141
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:37,660
required for doing this comparisons doing
this comparisons of mental weight and the

142
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,920
answer to this is no we do not have any idea
of what is the mental activity which is going

143
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,029
on what is the actual mental activity which
going on when comparing this face

144
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:55,769
obviously we will get answers on superficial
terms from people of whether two weights are

145
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:01,459
lighter or harder but what is the actual mental
activity which is acquire which is required

146
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:07,260
for doing this kind of calculation is not
possible lets take another example suppose

147
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:19,589
i asked you to describe ah the ear of a cat
what is the ear of a cat look like most people

148
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:28,109
will be able to do that but when i ask you
this question that when i said or when i asked

149
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:35,409
you what does the ear of a cat look like did
you actually bring forth an image of the cat

150
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:41,130
in your mind for answering this question not
many people will be able to answer it truthfully

151
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,940
saying that they do actually bring up the
idea or the image of a cat

152
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:54,030
why is that one reason is because we do predictions
and in terms of predictions we know how a

153
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,759
ear looks like and so how the cats ear would
look like it comes from semantic knowledge

154
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,230
and we really do not need to imagine a cat
and then look at its head and then look at

155
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,770
its ear in terms of mental activities to actually
come up with the idea of a ear of a cat or

156
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,630
describing the ear texture or shape of a cat
ear so these are some of the ah problems with

157
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,590
his theory or with his structuralism which
was a solution to that was attempted through

158
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:33,730
something called a new school which was functionalism
so the school of functionalism was started

159
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:43,210
by someone called william james and so william
james was ah off the idea that the nature

160
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:54,200
of mental activity is not the only solution
to ah studying cognition but rather the functions

161
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,690
of spec specific mental activities are what
require or or what is required what do i mean

162
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,019
by this
the functionalist perspective suggest that

163
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:14,769
the components of a mental activity are not
important but how those that mental activity

164
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:25,130
actually functions or actually is described
in in in a process is what is of interest

165
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:35,590
for example lets assume that we go to a lecture
now in a lecture for some people writing a

166
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,190
lecture down making note out of a lecture
down works that is how they learn and for

167
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:49,039
some other people listening to a lecture when
a lecture is being delivered is what is the

168
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,210
key is what is the key to ah to to understanding
ah of the contents of the lecture now the

169
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:03,630
people for whom listening a lecture or hearing
a lecture is the key to them for them to learn

170
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:11,389
what these people can do is find out what
aspects of listening in a lecture not writing

171
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:18,679
the lecture down actually helps them in understanding
the subject and lets suppose that they find

172
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:25,860
out or the reasons why they ah they subscribe
to listening a lecture is because when they

173
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,790
go into a lecture a listen to a lecture they
get a chance to ask questions or they get

174
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,040
a chance to see visual aids ah and learn things
these might be the reasons why listening to

175
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,110
a lecture is beneficial what they could do
is in future if they subscribe to a lecture

176
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,190
if they want to attend a lecture what they
can do is basically look at those lectures

177
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,090
which gives you opportunity to ask questions
they can look at teachers which give you opportunities

178
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,879
to ask more number of questions and then select
that particular lecture and learn for a while

179
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:05,519
so basically the functionalist approach says
that it is not the nature of mental activity

180
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,980
that is important what is important is how
the function of this is when this nature activity

181
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,799
actually ah takes place or when this the when
this nature activities are actually ah taking

182
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:29,590
place ah in in the real sense how does this
really ah go ahead and an explain mental process

183
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:36,710
so mental process is not just components of
ah mental images it is it is in terms of how

184
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:42,669
this mental process ah or how this the the
the acting out of this mental process actually

185
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:49,539
lets you gain knowledge
functionalism derives a lot from someone called

186
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:59,659
charles darwin ah who proposed that evolution
is ah the reason or the idea behind ah the

187
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,370
gaining of knowledge so basically the den
the the difference between functionalism and

188
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:10,039
structuralism in terms of explaining the history
of cognitive psychology is that structuralism

189
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:16,230
basically thought of mental processes thoughts
of mental images ah or prescribe the idea

190
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,679
that mental images are there and these mental
images can be broken down and then can be

191
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,389
studied and that is how a cognition or knowledge
is is generated

192
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:31,380
whereas functionalism talks about are not
these mental processes but rather how this

193
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,879
mental process operates the operation of these
mental processes is actually the way how people

194
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:45,149
generate ah knowledge
a third school which led or a third school

195
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:53,559
which led to the formation of cognitive psychology
was the get started school now this is a very

196
00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:04,000
simple school and this school proposed two
rules one that the whole is always more than

197
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,350
the sum of its part what does it really mean
it subscribes to the idea that if we see something

198
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,750
as a whole and if you see a part ah the same
thing as parts they may not give us the combined

199
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:24,380
experience think of it in terms of a movie
when we go to a movie we not only see the

200
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,870
pictures but we also see the sounds the which
is coming from the pictures the whole movie

201
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,929
experiences combined together to give you
the idea of what a movie is well as you take

202
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:43,020
take the movie apart the picture the music
the sound ah the other effects everything

203
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,580
taken ah apart from it and then show you show
them one by one to you will you have the same

204
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,970
experience no you will have entirely different
experience

205
00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:04,090
take another example the idea of a song now
song composed of lyrics it composes of music

206
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,809
which is there it composes of special effects
and so many other things into it now if i

207
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:15,690
take this apart if i first make you hear the
lyrics and later on add on or make you hear

208
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,549
ah the instruments which play with it and
later on come out show you or make make you

209
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,799
hear the basic effects or are the basic special
effects will you have the same experience

210
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,440
as when these combined together to form the
song no they are different and that is what

211
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,499
cognitive psychology or just all psychology
proposes of cognitive psychology

212
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:46,919
they say that the idea of studying cognition
is that cognitive psychology is that the experience

213
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,340
that you get from studying a whole process
is different from breaking the process apart

214
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,779
and so this school was in direct opposition
to william wundt school who proposed structuralism

215
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:03,649
where they said that the mental activity any
mental activity for that matter can be broken

216
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:09,830
down it is true parts studied and how knowledge
is gained her knowledge progresses can be

217
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,419
understood
another school which adds up or which basically

218
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:25,879
goes ahead and explains some of the basic
ideas about cognitive psychology or so one

219
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:31,919
of the basic ideas for cognitive psychology
is behaviorism now behaviorism was a school

220
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,570
which strictly proposed the idea that there
is a stimulus and there is a response and

221
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:45,450
each stimulus is bound to a particular kind
of a response so stimuluses leads to response

222
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:56,110
as the moon or main the optimal response is
always adapted as the effect of a stimulus

223
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:04,320
but behaviorism reasoned did was it didnt
subscribe to the idea of hidden mental states

224
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,929
rehesen behaviorism said since we are not
able to understand the mind we are since we

225
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:16,559
are not able to understand ah what is inside
somebodys head so let us look at what is observable

226
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,289
so one of the things one of the main propositions
of behaviorism was that lets look at what

227
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:28,630
is observable so if there is a stimulus and
it creates a response which can be observed

228
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,590
and this response could lead to a consequence
this is what it should be studied so study

229
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,940
a stimulus study a response and study a con
ah consequence to the response and this is

230
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,659
what should be the subject matter of cognitive
psychology cognitive psychologists should

231
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:46,159
not waste its time on what are the mental
processes what are the mental images what

232
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:53,779
is inside somebodys mind which and how they
direct the notions of knowledge gatherin

233
00:26:53,779 --> 00:27:07,629
clark hull one of the behaviorist he proposed
that although mental events cannot be studied

234
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:15,450
through behaviorism but their existence can
be deduced by their effect on behavior and

235
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:21,730
so what he says is that although things like
motivation which is basically ah internal

236
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:28,590
behavior or is an internal even they it cannot
be studied but what can be done is that its

237
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,720
effect of motivation can be studied on ah
behavior can be studied ah ah can be studied

238
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,899
through what people do when they are motivated
so if somebody is motivated he will produce

239
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,950
most optimal responses and based on that his
efforts on doing that particular job or doing

240
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:56,129
that particular act will increase and that
is why this increase in the response when

241
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:02,730
he gets rewarded by doing that response basically
shows the presence of motivation skinner who

242
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:10,600
was another ah behaviorist he went so far
ahead and said that look there are nothing

243
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,720
called internal events there are nothing called
mental process and so the basic idea or the

244
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,860
basic subject matter of cognitive psychology
should be stimulus response and consequences

245
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:29,990
studying the relationship with what stimulus
says is to what response and optimizing understanding

246
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,639
what is the optimal response to a particular
stimulus and then studying how these responses

247
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:40,940
are strengthen or weaken and that basically
happens through studying of consequences

248
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,080
the problem with behaviorist or the problem
why behaviorists were not successful in understanding

249
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,889
cognition or in developing cognitive psychology
was that they couldnt go ahead and explain

250
00:28:55,889 --> 00:29:02,230
some of the most interesting behaviors or
the existence are some of the most interesting

251
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,809
behaviors
for example the idea of language or how three

252
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:13,970
d perception and things like language or ah
death perception initiates in people this

253
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:24,860
led to the fall of behaviorism as a proponent
or as a school which ah explains you what

254
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,159
the subject matter of cognitive psychology
is or what cognitive psychology is all about

255
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:38,519
since most of these schools were trying to
understand what should we the subject matter

256
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,830
of cognitive psychology or what cognitive
psychology is all about none of the schools

257
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:55,869
could actually come up with a definitive answer
of what is the true subject matter of cognition

258
00:29:55,869 --> 00:30:04,980
behaviorism to some extent did give some very
good inputs for developing of a a theory of

259
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,670
cognition but they to fail in some ways because
they were not looking at external ah ex ah

260
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:20,760
events what behaviorism contributed was that
they developed some of the most rigorous ah

261
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,009
idea or experimental techniques of studying
cognition

262
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:34,090
also they for the first time ah went ahead
and studied animal cognition and they said

263
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,960
that studying the way animals behave could
lead to understanding how people behave or

264
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,980
how people gathered knowledge or how information
or how cognition really works so they although

265
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,909
didnt provide with ah enough matter to the
development of ah cognitive psychology but

266
00:30:53,909 --> 00:31:01,769
they ah did provide enough ah impetus to the
development of a new school of how knowledge

267
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:05,970
is gathered and what is mental activity questions
like ah these

268
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:18,429
a new school came in and they started explaining
what is the subject matter of the mind and

269
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,429
how is knowledge gathered and this school
was called the cognitive school or the cognitive

270
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:29,320
revolution now up till this point of time
we have been dealing with psychology we have

271
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,230
been dooling doing with experiments in psychology
where we are dealing with people who have

272
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:40,090
worked in psychology and ah they have been
giving ah several definitions of what psychology

273
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,830
is what it should do what cognitive psychology
should do what should be subject matter of

274
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,999
psych cognitive psychology how knowledge is
gained and those kind of things

275
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:57,610
but the new school that came in and that explained
what is cognitive psychology or what is ah

276
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:06,649
ah the basic way in which mental events or
mental processes a function was the cognitive

277
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:15,850
school this school started with the development
of the first computers and this school ah

278
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:21,360
came up or this school was proposed or came
out from the ideas of people like herbert

279
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,399
simon allen newell and noam chomsky
for the first time with the development of

280
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:35,769
computers psychologists got an opportunity
to model the working of the human mind in

281
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:47,679
terms of sets in terms of items which take
in information and process it and to understand

282
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:55,750
how thought processes or how human thinking
or mental processes are actually taken care

283
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:05,570
of by the mind
now the computer gave the cognitivist an ideal

284
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:20,659
medium to study the internal mechanism of
how information knowledge is grasped is processed

285
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:27,100
and is developed and is used so as i said
before people like hermans herbert simon and

286
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:34,210
newell who give ah the idea of computers gave
the idea of computer processing systems provided

287
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,029
a chance for the development of the field
of cognitive psychology

288
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:48,090
now the basic to understanding cognitive psychology
is studying the mind right up till now we

289
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,570
have been looking at schools or we have been
looking at viewpoints from various schools

290
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,749
of psychology and what do you think about
or how they ah affected the development of

291
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:04,200
cognitive psychology is a field
from now on we will be looking at what is

292
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,060
the subject matter of ah cognitive psychology
and how it should be studied what are the

293
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:17,949
processes and things like that so one of the
things that led or that is the core to understanding

294
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:24,789
cognitive psychology or human cognition is
understanding the working of the human mind

295
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:30,610
now with the development of computers or the
cognitive revolution there was a chance to

296
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:38,270
compare human mind working with the working
of the computers

297
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,219
but the problem was the working of the mental
activities which led to the working of the

298
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,588
mind of how mind generated knowledge or how
mind generated any activity and comparing

299
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:58,210
that to a computer program is not a correct
ah solution the reason is because the analog

300
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:09,730
of mental activities as computer programs
are wrong is because the mind and or the brain

301
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,980
and the computers are made up of in two different
kind of things or two different kind of elements

302
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,730
whereas the brain is made up of neurons and
biological structures the computers are made

303
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:32,490
up of hardware electronic circuits and several
other things ah which are not comparable on

304
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:41,859
any dimension also the mind the analogy which
says that the minds and computers are same

305
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:48,530
it proposes that the mind is the software
which runs on the hardware which is the brain

306
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:56,401
no as i said the comparison of ah the mind
and brain to an operating system and the computer

307
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:00,600
is not correct ah what are the reasons that
i gave is because they are made up of different

308
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:09,160
different kind of elements whereas the brain
is made up of neurons and neural structures

309
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,760
and biologic based materials ah the computers
on the other hand are made up of electrical

310
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,880
circuits
also if you look at the mind and the brain

311
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,640
the brain the mind works on top of the brain
right which means that the operating system

312
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,200
of the brain and the brain itself are one
and the same thing or is a spot off of the

313
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:48,170
same ah structure whereas computers dont have
this specificity the idea here is that computer

314
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,510
programs can be run on different kind of computers
if i have an operating system no matter what

315
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,210
computer i have no matter what kind of hardware
that i have i can run this operating system

316
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:05,280
on it and so the hardware the operating system
the mind in terms of a computer an analog

317
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,750
can run on different different hardwares
whereas the mind that a person has the brain

318
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:18,190
which generates the mind this cannot be transported
to other person up till now this is not possible

319
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:24,780
where i can take in somebodys mind and and
transplant it to somebody elses hardware brain

320
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,660
and make these people similar
now these are some of the this is actually

321
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:39,609
one of the most theoretical questions or i
would say ah thought experiments in philosophy

322
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:46,780
where ah it is described that if i take the
mind the brain of someone a part of brain

323
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:52,500
or someone and implant it to someone else
ah who who was having a malfunction brain

324
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,410
as brains can can function ah ah half brains
can function on their own will they be the

325
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,339
same person now that is that is a thought
experiment in philosophy and so this is the

326
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:07,970
question here
so if i take your mind and put this mind lets

327
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,609
lets assume that i can take your mind and
put this on somebody elses hardware the brain

328
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:18,290
will two of you function similarly because
the brain is more or less similar in most

329
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:24,180
people and so it doesnt but on the other hand
in terms of computers what really happens

330
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,490
is that if i take an os operating system and
i take it to any hardware it keeps on functioning

331
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:40,400
or it keeps on ah working in the same way
also some software programs are so basic that

332
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:49,319
at times we take these ah software programs
and convert them into some kind of hardware

333
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:56,599
some kind of ah hardware programs for example
the basic i c chips which allows ah certain

334
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:05,390
ah currents or ah certain signals ah certain
kind of gates which are there in electronics

335
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:11,410
engineering
so at times simple programs computer programs

336
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:19,589
can we actually ah converted it into a chip
and this chip can be later on used for used

337
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:27,390
for ah use as an hardware but basic human
programs or basic human processes cannot be

338
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:34,589
converted into a part of the brain and can
be or ah shifted so thats what ah this it

339
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:39,560
says that sometimes deputy programs can be
cut converted into electrical circuits whereas

340
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,109
for humans is not possible
so then what is the how do we differ between

341
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:54,920
the brain in the computer or the brain and
the mind this can be understood in terms of

342
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,510
the various levels of analysis what does this
really mean levels of analysis actually means

343
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:09,109
the point from where you are seeing something
the point from where you are analyzing a particular

344
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:17,579
feature for example in a computer program
the two levels of analysis can be in terms

345
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,670
of the basic electrical current the basic
circuits that the brain has and the physics

346
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,170
of ah the computer
so one level of analysis will be how current

347
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,839
flows through ah several hardwares in a computer
and how these leads to the functioning of

348
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:40,380
the computer on a second level on another
level of analysis computers can also be understood

349
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:47,450
in terms of what various programs do how these
various programs go ahead what kind of processes

350
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:53,750
they do that they have what kind of functions
that they do and how they go ahead and and

351
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:59,589
actually ah create an output from the input
given

352
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:05,010
so one level is the physical level in in terms
of computers understanding levels of analysis

353
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,530
could be understanding computers in terms
of the physics of it in terms of the in terms

354
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,190
of the electrical circuits that it has or
in terms of the programs that run on it and

355
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:21,970
that describe the computer now for understand
this with a more easy example

356
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:29,510
lets say we are looking at a building so what
i am trying to tell you is what are different

357
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:36,020
levels of analysis so lets think of a building
one level of analysis of a building would

358
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,260
be the architecture would be the way the building
is constructed the design of the building

359
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,109
how it is how it looks what kind of rooms
it has and so on and so forth so this is a

360
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:50,380
higher level analysis
a lower level of analysis or another level

361
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,559
of analysis of this building could be in terms
or the bricks that is used to make this building

362
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:03,770
the cement that is used the steel rods which
are used and so in terms of the basic components

363
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:13,880
we make up the building although both levels
of analysis are talking about the same building

364
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,740
but they have different different viewpoints
of it and so this building can be explained

365
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,539
with the analysis with the level of the architecture
architecture input or it could be understood

366
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,470
in terms of the level of the basic building
materials

367
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:33,320
so then this is how the distinction of the
brain and the mind can be ah done true through

368
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:40,859
different levels of analysis what this would
mean is that when we are looking at any ah

369
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:48,799
mental process we can look at a mental process
from both a functional view as well as a structural

370
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:56,200
view
lets look at emotions what is the functional

371
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:05,400
view of an emotion the functional view of
an emotion is it is an arousal state it is

372
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,039
a state of arousal which quickly clients and
ah gets back to normal and through which people

373
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:18,010
experience feelings this is more of functional
view but what is the structural view of looking

374
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,450
at an emotion
the structural view of an emotion could be

375
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:27,440
expressed in terms of the brain regions which
lead to the emotion and probably the areas

376
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,760
which are related to amygdala or areas near
to it which leads to generation of an emotion

377
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:42,220
so the same emotion that i am talking about
the same ah emotion that people have can be

378
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:48,560
expressed both on a functional level in terms
of what people feel and also in terms of the

379
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,359
structural level of which regions the brain
lead to the development of this particular

380
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,869
feeling or with this particular emotion
another interesting thing or another input

381
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:09,839
matter subject matter of cognitive psychology
are mental representation what a mental representation

382
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:17,680
whenever we think about something maybe it
could be a job it could be thinking about

383
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,670
a friend a particular vacation whenever we
think about this a lot of mental activities

384
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:32,800
takes place in the brain and so these mental
activities actually excess or actually use

385
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,720
something called mental representations
so generally what is a mental representation

386
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:45,130
a mental representation is basically a physical
state that conveys information specifying

387
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:53,160
an object event or category or its characteristics
in terms of paper and pen a mental representation

388
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:59,580
would be the ink which writes a particular
letter the way the particular letter is written

389
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:06,130
in terms the brain it could be the neural
connections which leads to a particular kind

390
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:12,609
of ah network connection a particular kind
of mental state disease generated or in terms

391
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,220
of computers it could be a particular kind
of magnetic field

392
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:25,359
so mental representation basically is a notion
is a represent the way something is stored

393
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:33,990
each mental representation or most mental
representations have two things in common

394
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:39,339
one is a form of the mental representation
and the second is the content of a mental

395
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:43,160
representation
what is the form of a mental representation

396
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:52,200
the form of a mental representation states
the way a particular message is conveyed the

397
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,240
format in which it is conveyed the way in
which it is encode and the content of a mental

398
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:06,940
representation is basically the meaning the
knowledge the idea which is being conveyed

399
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,500
to that representation
so basically mental representation is ah think

400
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:25,730
of it is a ah unit of knowledge and this unit
of knowledge has a form which is in which

401
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,910
format it has been encoded so it could be
encoded in visual format it could be encoded

402
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:35,140
in auditory format it could be encoded in
some other format a haptic format and the

403
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:41,750
content is what is the ah data bytes into
it what is the knowledge into it so mostly

404
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:46,789
representations are like that
let us understand what mental representations

405
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:52,190
are and when i say that a mental representation
is a unit of knowledge and it can it has a

406
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:57,190
form and and a particular kind of a form and
a particular kind of content let me explain

407
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:05,950
this a little bit more
for example i want to convey to you the following

408
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:14,900
sentence the ball is on the box this sentence
means or this idea means that there is something

409
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:23,880
on something a subject an object and a relation
between a subject an object or it represents

410
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:33,190
an idea now this idea has two parts one is
what is second is where and the third is on

411
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:39,329
what so the bodies of the box the idea of
a ball being in a box can be conveyed through

412
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:46,550
two kinds of representations we can use a
propositional representation and we can use

413
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:52,500
a quasi pictorial representation what is the
meaning of that prepositional response are

414
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:59,950
representations will tell you two ideas and
how are these ideas related together whereas

415
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:07,349
a quasi pictorial representation is going
to tell you show you a picture of how these

416
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:14,069
ideas are related together so when i look
at the proposition of representation looking

417
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:25,119
into it i have the ball which is on the box
right so ball and box are two ideas or two

418
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,140
representations which are connected by a representation
on which basically means that something on

419
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:37,150
something and in this case there is a ball
which is a circular in shape and which is

420
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,119
on top of a box which may be or rectangular
in shape

421
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,710
so then what this representation proportional
presentation explains is a relationship first

422
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:56,859
of all so the ball is in the box if i represent
it through prepositions it could be in terms

423
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:00,970
it could it could have in terms of proportional
disposition it should have a relation how

424
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,809
the two ideas are connected together that
undulation here is on

425
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:11,650
second an argument what representations or
what ideas are connected i have a connector

426
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,480
on which is connecting two ideas but what
are the ideas which is being connected the

427
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:22,650
ball in the box what is the syntax of connecting
now if i just write on ball box it is not

428
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:29,150
going to make any meaning there is a syntax
to it a syntax a is that one ball a ball it

429
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:37,280
could be anything on which is the connector
a box on one thing and the then the connector

430
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,700
is so this ball is basically on the box lift
up when i am saying that i am talking about

431
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,760
the particular ball the particular box then
the abstract what is the abstract the ball

432
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,829
in the box the shapes of the balls in the
box

433
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:02,010
then the propositional representation it doesnt
happen in a special media in spatial media

434
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,529
and the reason that it does not hap happen
in space it does not explain you in space

435
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:10,490
how these are related so in space you will
you will generate the idea in your head that

436
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,990
there is a ball and there is a box and the
ball is on the box but you cannot see the

437
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:19,829
picture of the ball on the box although you
will it will generate the same idea of the

438
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:25,549
ball being on the box and arbitrarily related
to repre represent objects it can be arbitrarily

439
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:30,059
related to it
when i use a quasi pictorial representation

440
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:38,170
for explaining the same idea the ball is in
the box i can draw a ball which is spherical

441
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:44,200
in shape and a box oh here i have to be very
specific i cannot draw a triangular ball neither

442
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:51,290
can i draw a cubical box ah ah hectagonal
box obviously it is allowed but then most

443
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,260
box will have rectangular or squarish surface
and so i have to be very strictly to that

444
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:04,950
also the preposition of on suggest that the
spherical shape has to be on top of the shape

445
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,900
of the box
and so in this case there is no distinct relation

446
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:17,960
there is no distinct arguments no clear syntax
no concrete ideas but then what happens is

447
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:26,380
it happens this can be expressed in a spatial
medium what does these mean what is the meaning

448
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:36,150
of this the meaning of this is mental representations
or mental ideas can not only be expressed

449
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:42,119
in terms of words or in terms of prepositions
in terms of ideas and connector connectors

450
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:48,470
connecting these ideas but it will also be
expressed in terms of just images and so images

451
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:55,260
are one way of conveying an idea
lets take another example ram is running if

452
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:03,240
i say the sentence ram is running the two
ways of showing it i can use running which

453
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:10,430
is a verb or i can and then i can use ram
which is the noun and then show the relation

454
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:15,190
between that running is done by ram this is
a propositional so making the preposition

455
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:21,839
or i can draw somebody running doing the act
of running or make a cartoon of it and running

456
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,940
and then i can show that ram is running by
that particular thing both these representations

457
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,099
both these formats will actually convey the
same meaning

458
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:35,410
so coming back to the idea that mental representations
have a particular format and a particular

459
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:41,609
idea or a particular content as you can see
both these ways of representations have a

460
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:47,230
format the first one has a propositional format
and the second one has the quasi representational

461
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:53,660
format which is a special format of encoding
ideas what is the content the content of the

462
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,700
first is there is a an object a which is on
top of object b similarly with the pictorial

463
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:07,260
representations also the same idea or the
same information is being conveyed that a

464
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,650
is on top of b
so then these mental representations that

465
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:18,510
we have can actually or how do these mental
representations work the working of these

466
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:29,420
mental representations takes place through
a process a processing system and algorithm

467
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:35,990
so once we see something once we form a mental
representation this mental representation

468
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:43,010
is taken by the mind and this then this mind
makes meaning out of it through using a process

469
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:51,020
or processing system and an algorithm
what does the process do the process takes

470
00:53:51,020 --> 00:54:02,220
in basic information and produces specific
out of it so the process will look at the

471
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,230
mental representation whether it is in propositional
form or in special form encode it through

472
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:18,940
a ah ah through a system of pros perception
attention that kind of ah thing a processing

473
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:25,630
system will compose of several processes and
these several processes will combine with

474
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:34,060
one another to give a output to give us the
idea that a is on b or that this is what is

475
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:40,360
being conveyed
so a process is basically one part of a processing

476
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,710
system a process is basically a format or
is is basically a process through which something

477
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:53,559
is some information is taken and this information
is transformed into specific type of output

478
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:59,890
this specific output is later on combined
through or it is is pros is passed through

479
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:06,410
several processes and these several processes
generally are comprised in something called

480
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:13,230
a processing system
so for example going back to the original

481
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:21,480
thing looking at the quasi representational
description looking at this makes you understand

482
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:27,700
this knowledge that a ball is on the box now
for this for you to understand that the ball

483
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,710
is on the box there are several processes
responsible and there is a processing system

484
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:37,309
which is processing it one process the first
process i would say which is responsible as

485
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:42,440
attention you have to pay your attention to
this particular image the special image the

486
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:49,500
process of attention will take out everything
else from the the vicinity of this particular

487
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:58,110
picture and what it will do is it will only
concentrate your mental concentration onto

488
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:04,079
this box and and this ball
the process of perception will let you understand

489
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,510
this or encode this in a visual format and
then there will be process of memory through

490
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:14,609
which what will happen is there will be a
comparison of the size of this the shape of

491
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:21,319
this the relation between this and then there
will be a process of thinking of up ah decision

492
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:25,010
making will not be a process here but then
this is how you will develop the idea that

493
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:29,760
the ball is on the table
so the processing system comprises of several

494
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,630
processes and these several processes one
after another gives you the final output an

495
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:43,390
algorithm is basically a step by step procedure
of how the processing system should function

496
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:51,599
so any processing system should function in
a particular way in a particular in in a particular

497
00:56:51,599 --> 00:57:01,099
direction and this algorithms tell you how
to where to start where to go from there what

498
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:06,130
to expect out of it and then where to go from
there again

499
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:15,789
for example in the idea of perceiving the
ball and the box the algorithm tells the mind

500
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:25,849
or the brain to first look at the shapes pay
your attention to the shapes cut out the or

501
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:31,630
separate the background from the foreground
perceive this in the through the eyes in the

502
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:37,799
visual format hold it into working memory
let the central executive and an episodic

503
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:42,859
buffer of working memory talk to long term
memory and make a comparison of what you are

504
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:52,750
seeing and based on that generating this output
that this particular figure shows a ball on

505
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,369
the table so this is how the algorithm says
so it starts the algorithm says that it starts

506
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:02,369
with attention goes to perception goes to
memory those to this kind of memory they are

507
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:11,750
retrievers and then make making the decision
of how this ball is on the table or how the

508
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:19,119
what this particular picture explains
so up till now what we have seen is what is

509
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:26,240
the history of cognitive psychology and we
have looked at the schools of area schools

510
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:37,630
which gave their inputs or which led to the
development of the field of cognitive psychology

511
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:43,079
and we have also looked at what is the subject
matter of cognitive psychology we looked at

512
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,460
what are mental representations how they can
be encoded what is the ah ah format in which

513
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:55,599
we can encode and things like that we will
continue our journey by understanding why

514
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,240
should we study the brain at all if mind is
of what is importance why should be studying

515
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:08,000
the brain and then following on following
this we will also look at the several paradigms

516
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,869
of cognitive psychology or what are the basic
bodies of knowledge of cognitive psychology

517
00:59:14,869 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you
