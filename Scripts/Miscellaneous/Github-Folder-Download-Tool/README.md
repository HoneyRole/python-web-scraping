# Github-Folder-Download-Tool
A tool for downloading a single github folder (and its subfolders and files) ... 

NOTES: Accepts a github folder url as input and downloads the entire content of the folder! ... No more downloading a whole repository just to get a folder

TODO:

[-] Proper and Xtensive Error handling ... the tool is still in it's early stages ...

[-] Implement the tool using svn ...

[-] Rewrite using urllib3 or urllib2 ... as download time is still a little slow

[-] Anything! you! think! will! make! it! awesome!


** Track future changes and development in my repository
